Derek Sivers set up a website called [nownownow.com](http://nownownow.com/about) to help people understand what a now page is, why you‚Äôd want one, and to [showcase other now pages](http://nownownow.com/). Maybe you should build one, too.

## What Am I Doing *Now*?

I live in Central PA and I am currently learning at a breakneck pace full-stack web development with [Wes Bos Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

I am trying to get into better shape and am doing well at it.

I am currently waiting to get things set up to freelance for CivicMapper.

I am working on two¬†blogs:

This one, Tiffany R. White Blog

[That Mac Nerd](https://thatmacnerd.com/)
‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶

I am building a markdown grammar checker called [Check Yo Self](https://github.com/twhite96/checkyoself).

## What's On My Pocket Computer?

We carry these things everywhere. Inspired by another `/now` page I am posting a screenshot of my iPhone and iPad, and also my iMac.

    <figcaption>The lone icon on my iPad Pro homescreen is a Runtastic body weight home exercise app. I used to be religious about the gym, losing <strong>a lot</strong> of weight. I had a pretty rough go of it the last couple years and have gained a lot of weight back. Need to get healthy and this is a start. The rest is easy access to apps for multitasking.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>The new Siri watch face in watchOS 5 is a great addition, great enough to get me to switch from Modular. Loving it so far.</figcaption>

This may seem like a lot and it is. I don't know if I'll get everything done, but if I get into more of a routine, I think it is doable.

What are you doing? I‚Äôm curious by nature. Share it with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412) Or don‚Äôt.¬†ü§∑üèø
