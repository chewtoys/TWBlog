Derek Sivers set up a website called [nownownow.com](http://nownownow.com/about) to help people understand what a now page is, why you‚Äôd want one, and to [showcase other now pages](http://nownownow.com/). Maybe you should build one, too.

## What Am I Doing *Now*?

I live on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, PA and I am currently learning at a breakneck pace full-stack web development with [Wes Bos Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

I am trying to get into better shape and am doing well at it.

I am currently waiting to hear back from another internsh
I am working on two¬†blogs:

This one, Tiffany R. White Blog

[That Mac Nerd](https://thatmacnerd.com/blog/)
‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶

I am building a markdown grammar checker called [Check Yo Self](https://github.com/twhite96/checkyoself).

I am working on launching a new podcast called [DevBytes](https://devbytes.tech/home/).

I also have Evernote and Programming [^1] books in the works.

## What's On My Pocket Computer?

We carry these things everywhere. Inspired by another `/now` page I am posting a screenshot of my iPhone and iPad, and also my iMac.

    <figcaption>My Apple Watch is minimal on notifications (except Slack, which I will fix tonight) and closing most of my rings keeps me motivated. I can triage tasks and reply to messages without picking up my phone. Win.</figcaption>

## What's On My Mac?

This may seem like a lot and it is. I don't know if I'll get everything done, but if I get into more of a routine, I think it is doable.

What are you doing? I‚Äôm curious by nature. Share it with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412) Or don‚Äôt.¬†ü§∑üèø
