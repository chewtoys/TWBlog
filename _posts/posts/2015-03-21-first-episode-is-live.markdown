My **first ever podcast** is live and available on SoundCloud. I am not certain how I am going to structure it, how I am going to write show notes every week, etc. but the shot in the dark is thrilling. I recorded the episode last night, accidentally deleted it in GarageBand, re-recorded, and edited it tonight for **THREE HOURS**. I have a screencast to do for another blog, some programming homework, and I need to study for a quiz I have for Human Biology Monday. This is my weekend? It feels like work! But it's *awesome*.

Here it is!
