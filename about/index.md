## Hi. I'm Tiffany.
I am a non-traditional computer science major at the University of Pittsburgh, main campus.

I read more than I watch TV, think more than necessary, especially when I am supposed to be sleeping, and am navigating my way around the programming universe.

This blog is an expos√® on the things I am learning and can explain. For a detailed blog about how I got here look no further than [Just Another Software Engineering Blog](https://helloburgh.me/home/).
