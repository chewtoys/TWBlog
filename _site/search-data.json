      "content"	 : "  Hey y‚Äôall. Been a while. It has been super crazy as I am moving in literally one week and consulting is a craziness unto itself. I‚Äôve also broken the chain of posting at least once a month for 4 years but hey. I have a good reason to have missed. üòúOne of the things I am learning while working is how to recognize patterns.Pattern recognition is a skillI have terrible pattern recognition abilities1. This was a thing that stood out on the I.Q. tests I‚Äôve taken by psychologists, once in my teens, and the other just recently.This industry is based on pattern recognition. It is vital to your survival as a dev. If you can‚Äôt recognize patterns in your code, then you won‚Äôt succeed. At all.Luckily, mostly everything you write is some type of pattern.Take a look at this:const arr = [1,2,3,4,5]for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; arr.length; i++) {  console.log(arr[i]);}Basically, we‚Äôre just taking the arr array and iterating over it with a for loop and logging the index to the console. You see this everywhere, in every language based on C or some variant of C. It‚Äôs a design pattern called, you guessed it, the Iterator Design Pattern.It took me an absurdly long time to recognize this is what a pattern is. Once I learned what these patterns looked like, I started noticing them everywhere.Object Creator PatternYou know how to create objects: the object literal, constructor, and the class. The way you instantiate each of these is a pattern.// Object literalconst myObj = {  // some props}// constructor functionfunction MyObject() {  this.someProp = someProp;  this.someOtherProp = someOtherProp;}const anotherObject = new MyObject();// classclass newObject {  constructor(x, y) {    this.x = x;    this.y = y;  }}See? If you know how to do anything like this, some sort of standard way of crafting code that you see repeated over and over, most likely it is a pattern2.            The longer I do this though, the better I am getting.¬†&amp;#8617;              Design patterns have to be standardized by a body of computer scientists/theorists/technicians and can‚Äôt just be created by any old dev.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

My supervisor is great as well1.Emails‚Ä¶so many emailsWhen people complained about getting too many emails I didn‚Äôt see what the issue was; you‚Äôre working and doing important things! Why wouldn‚Äôt you want emails?Well, it can get to be too much. It is my first week and I enjoyed the correspondence but by week‚Äôs end my brain was completely fatigued. I‚Äôll get used to it for sure but for the first week and onboarding and all that it was a bit overwhelming.Sprints and scrumsThe sprint we had was amazing. Our PM was nice, the guys were nice and there was a lot of laughter. I don‚Äôt suspect sprints will always be like this but for a first time this was encouraging.Retirement and health plansThis‚Ä¶is just‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt know what to say about it. Truly. You work at Target, Quizno‚Äôs and the local library all your life and having a 401k seems unreal, and it feels silly coming out of my mouth.

      "content"	 : "Yea so this is a long story. Long. But it is worth telling because maybe it can help one of you guys.First, a little bit of backgroundI‚Äôve been someone without a lot of money for a long time and by not a lot of money I mean below the poverty line since I stepped out on my own.  Warning: This will not be a rah rah or woe is me post. Stuff happens and sometimes it happens to good people. I am not here for sympathy, just a direct telling of my circumstances.I spent a lot of time in school. A lot. I was young and directionless, picking up an electronics engineering degree program at the local community college, then physics, then humanities and then I moved 200 miles from home in my mid-thirties to go to Pitt for computer science.I had and have no family obligations so this is probably something someone at that age or my age currently would not be able to do, and in this way, despite the poverty and lifelong hardships, this is a privilege I have that a lot of folks do not.So I quit. And I started freeCodeCamp, Codeacademy, Udemy, and the like.A struggle results in good thingsI struggled through freeCodeCamp‚Äôs algorithm challenges, I struggled through the frontend projects on the first iteration of freeCodeCamp; I‚Äôve been a camper since literally the beginning and while I have no certifications I did work daily for the most part on the curriculum.I bought The Web Developer Bootcamp  by Colt Steele and worked through the entire thing and got the certificate after four months of work and a working YelpCamp  full-stack app.It was around this time I got offered an internship at a company you may be familiar with. I was ecstatic; my first real dev‚Ä¶job? I thought so. I thought that when all was said and done the job was mine.But it didn‚Äôt turn out that way.Failure to plan, failure to succeedI started out of the gate fast picking up Rails and making small changes relatively quickly. But I didn‚Äôt take notes, Slack was hard for me to stay in as I just wanted to work and not get into chats in Slack so I wasn‚Äôt communicating at all. Needless to say my mid-internship review was pretty bad.I couldn‚Äôt build things in the proper way, partially because I was new to Rails and partially because I didn‚Äôt take notes which resulted in poor planning. I was remote and this made it hard for me to pick Rails up quickly as there was no one down the hall and Slack was our main mode of communicating.To add to this, I was being thrown out of my apartment because of renovations. I had a month to find a place and Pittsburgh has a dearth of affordable housing which meant I needed to move back to my hometown. I was devastated and completely shutdown, not communicating hardly at all with anyone. I saved around $6,000 and moved home last year in April.The search beginsI got back and vowed to leave again because I hated this place when I left it and I didn‚Äôt want to be back here.I started searching for work. I interviewed with big companies like Microsoft and Automattic and while I made it to the final round of Microsoft‚Äôs interview, I needed more practice with established algorithms that I really can‚Äôt talk about here because I am still under NDA.I was broken for the rest of the year. Literally not caring about anything at all. Lost. I gave up looking for work as it had been years since I started this journey and nothing was happening.I burned out and basically had a nervous breakdown. Money was really tight. I wasn‚Äôt eating well at all because I didn‚Äôt have the money to, as well as gaining weight because of it.A new year and new sense of purpose.I wrote a blog post detailing how I was going to pull myself up out of that funk I was in: I programmed very little last year after the failed interviews. Over the years I watched my friends drop out of the whole learning to code endeavor and I felt bad for them. Of course, they all had families and work and I didn‚Äôt have any of that, again, my bit of privilege despite being underprivileged in many ways.I laid out the groundwork for getting a job this year in Notion and began work on doing just that.I increased my streak on freeCodeCamp from 4 to 36 consecutive days with 579 points.            ![Screenshot-2019-07-05_04-40-07_PM      690x343](2.png)      I applied to more positions but nothing turned up.Taking a shot on DEV ListingsDEV Listings is a new endeavor by the DEV team to help prospective coders to get a job/mentor/collaborator, etc by allowing you to put up basically an ad/listing to share your links and tell them why they should hire you.I took a chance on this and waited.And waited.The build upOne day on Twitter I complained that I wasn‚Äôt getting anything at all and that seeing people start their tech careers was weighing on me.Shortly after that, the VP of a company contacted me on Twitter. We talked over the phone and we set up an initial phone screen. The person screening me that day really, really liked me and what I was about.This lead to the second and final round of interviews which were technical. These interviews were video interviews that would last for two hours total.I tripped up on something simple like fetching data from an API to lazy load some content from a server; I complicate a lot of things and while I knew it and eventually got around to the correct answer, I thought too much about it and I felt really stupid.I then talked to the backend dev and the project manager and they were really impressed.My mentor and I felt like this was it. Everyone I talked to about if felt like this was it but I had been through the process so much I didn‚Äôt get my hopes up at all.Goal, completedI was outside waiting for some packages and I got the call. My recruiter from the company said they wanted to offer me an entry level frontend dev position making quite a bit more than the market rate if I‚Äôm being honest. I felt‚Ä¶relief. I had been breaking out in hives from all the stress.I am now a junior frontend dev at a great company and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.ConclusionIt has been years, years since I decided to switch majors to software engineering from humanities, drop out of college, and start this process.People I‚Äôve cared about and started the journey with have come and gone, with three of us left standing.I did not quit and it is mainly because I couldn‚Äôt afford to. Literally.If you have been through the hell of having your life derailed from no fault of your own like me, it is really, really tough to want to start this journey when you are constantly hungry or depressed because you‚Äôre hungry. It is a vicious cycle of despair that is hard to break. The statistics for us don‚Äôt look great.But tech allows people like you and me to break the shackles of poverty if you‚Äôre stubborn and consistently persistent in the pursuit.It‚Äôs doable. I did it.Don‚Äôt quit. Not now, not when life is good and especially not when life is bad.Put in the work. It may take a long time but the payoff is better than the alternate.Good luck. You got this.",

      "content"	 : "  This post is a recycled newsletter I just recently released but with extra content.From the newsletter:Last year‚Äôs hell is this year‚Äôs hangover, or so it seems.There are periods of intense studying, thinking about problems, filling up my freeCodeCamp consecutive days streak in dark green squares.Then there are‚Ä¶other days. Days where everything is taxing and sleep is your best friend.I have a lot of those days lately. And the issue?I have been at this a long time with minimal success.This is really my fault; I literally have no one to blame but myself.I‚Äôve spent an egregious amount of time on video tutorials and am just now finding out I learn best by doing. Trying to figure out how to get a Search component working on my site was hard but necessary.Years wasted. And I sat around feeling sorry for myself; feeling that twinge of envy every time someone got a new job as a junior. I knew, know, I am not doing enough, wasn‚Äôt doing enough. Depression and burnout will do that to you.Spending years on go is difficult to sustain. You will crash. And I did. Several times. And went about doing things the same way again.F*ck Complacency.I really had to get real with myself.  What do I really want?  What am I willing to do to get it?  What safeguards can I put in place so that this type of long burnout never happens again?  How hard am I willing to try by putting myself out there and putting in the work?I really want to be a developer.I am willing to put in the hours, even when I don‚Äôt want to, to get it.I need to listen to my body and take the weekend for self-care. Self-care is a loaded buzzword but I didn‚Äôt do it for many years and now I am stuck, 4 years programming with nothing to show for it. I journal. A lot. I see a professional. I have a photography hobby I really enjoy. I have this dope robot car I am building. I do this on the weekends. I go out with friends and have friends over. I won‚Äôt get into too many details but I really missed this while I was in Pittsburgh. And if I ever move from here again, I really need to make sure I actually know some people in the new area.Robots are pretty coolI am willing to anything. And this is where other‚Äôs success comes in.Seeing the folks over the weekend sharing their freeCodeCamp JavaScript and Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms certificates made a little angry, not at them, but myself. I have been a camper since the beginning, making an account when they were still using Ruby and other course sites to help you learn. I have zero certificates. None. I am super ashamed of this.         View this post on Instagram           Working on #algorithms at #freeCodeCamp and Udemy. I keep seeing people complete the algorithm challenges and a little fire has been lit underneath me to actually get at least ONE freeCodeCamp certificate. I&amp;#39;ve been there since the beginning. It&amp;#39;s kind of embarrassing at this point. . . . . . #webdeveloper #webdevelopment #programming #programmer #reactjs #javascript #developer #devlife #womenwhocode #womencoders #coder #coding #codinglife A post shared by  Tiffany White (@tiffanywhitedev) on May 19, 2019 at 2:19pm PDTOne of the ways I am motivating myself is having this random certificate frame I picked up from the Dollar Tree. It is going up on the wall in front of my desk as a reminder of what I need to do to fill it with a freeCodeCamp certificate.Setting up a study planI have a couple Google Sheets I setup to help me study.If you want to use them, you can find them at the following places:Job Ready: Study Plan for Front-End EmploymentCS Study PlansAddendumI can‚Äôt stress enough how important it is to have support systems, and good ones, either virtually or in person, especially in person, around you.I didn‚Äôt have any of this in Pittsburgh and it is taking some time for me to get out of recluse mode back here in my hometown. As I said above, I am trying to take my health, mental or otherwise more seriously. It doesn‚Äôt help that my birthday was earlier this month, and none of use are getting any younger. I can‚Äôt afford to neglect my health any longer. I did that for far to long and it cost me, big time, in the summer of last year.I have friends here I‚Äôve known for 20 some odd years. We hang out. Whenever I am depressed or burned out, they are always there for me and if they are having a hard time, I try to be there for them.It‚Äôs the weekend right now, early morning. I am about to just publish this and head upstairs. I am thankful for my friends and family because without them this past year I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have made it.",

      "title": "Three Ways to Pass Props to Components Outside of Parent/Child Relationships",
      "content"	 : "  It is really late here on the East Coast but I have been wanting to get this out for weeks now. If there are any errors or wrong examples/logic, you can edit this post on GitHub. All suggestions welcome.React excels at urging users to use a to use top down data flow for getting state passed between components. This is usually done in a parent/child relationship in a tree of elements.But what if I want to pass data to and from components not in a parent/child relationship?Ways to pass the data around the treeRender propThe first way you can pass data around the tree is by using a render prop. What is a render prop?  A render prop is a function prop that a component uses to let React know what to render.You are already familiar with a render prop: the children prop is also a render prop.  Another way to utilize the render props pattern is with React‚Äôs children prop. If you‚Äôve never used props.children before, it‚Äôs just like any other prop, accept instead of you passing it explicitly to the component, React automatically does it for you and it reference whatever is in the body of the component.‚Äî Tyler McGinnisRender prop exampleHere‚Äôs an example1 of a render prop in action:class User extends React.Component {  // render prop function  addUser = () =&amp;gt; {   // add new user from some api  }  render() {    return (      this.props.children(this.addUser)    );  }}&amp;lt;User&amp;gt;  // passing the addUser function as a prop  // or &quot;render prop&quot; ‚úÖ  {addUser =&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;AddUserButton onclick={addUser} /&amp;gt;  }&amp;lt;/User&amp;gt;This is basically passing a callback function as a prop. That‚Äôs it.Higher-Order Components (HOCs)  A higher order component is a function that takes and returns a new componentComponents will transform props into UI. In this case, a HOC transforms a component into another component.Take this example:// A wrapper componentconst WrapperComponent = ({  username,  ...otherProps}) =&amp;gt; (  &amp;lt;div {...otherProps}&amp;gt;    Username: {username}.  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;);// A new, enhanced component that will set a name prop// on a base component to &quot;New Name&quot;const withChangedUsername = WrapperComponent =&amp;gt; props =&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;WrapperComponent {...props} username=&quot;bored potato&quot;/&amp;gt;);const EnhancedComponent = withChangedUsername(WrapperComponent);Using the React Context APIThe Context API is a way to pass props to other components in the tree without needing to pass those props down to every component in the tree. The data can be considered global.You can create a new Context like so:const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);You can pass props down to other components implicitly with the &amp;lt;Provider&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;Consumer&amp;gt; components in the API.The &amp;lt;Provider&amp;gt; component provides the context of whatever data you‚Äôre passing. The &amp;lt;Consumer&amp;gt; component subscribes to any changes being passed from the &amp;lt;Context&amp;gt; component.Styled-components library exampleOne of the most popular methods of using Context globally is for theming.Here is an example of theming using React‚Äôs Context API in the styled-components library:// Define our button, but with the use of props.theme this timeconst Button = styled.button`  color: ${props =&amp;gt; props.theme.fg};  border: 2px solid ${props =&amp;gt; props.theme.fg};  background: ${props =&amp;gt; props.theme.bg};  font-size: 1em;  margin: 1em;  padding: 0.25em 1em;  border-radius: 3px;`;// Define our `fg` and `bg` on the themeconst theme = {  fg: &quot;palevioletred&quot;,  bg: &quot;white&quot;};// This theme swaps `fg` and `bg`const invertTheme = ({ fg, bg }) =&amp;gt; ({  fg: bg,  bg: fg});render(  // provider component  &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={theme}&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;Button&amp;gt;Default Theme&amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;ThemeProvider theme={invertTheme}&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;Button&amp;gt;Inverted Theme&amp;lt;/Button&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/ThemeProvider&amp;gt;);Use each of these patterns sparinglyThere are pros and cons to these patterns. It is best to use whatever pattern is best for your project.            A contrived example but an example nonetheless¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

I spent 12 hours over three days creating the repo, gathering books I had read or that were recommended to me; articles I found that had an effect on the way I think about web development and those that were recommended to me.Awesome list or not to Awesome listOriginally it was made to be an Awesome list. I was chasing that clout, of course; getting my repo in front of thousands of eyes was appealing. But as I worked on it I felt that the requirements left me very little freedom to make the list my own. So I scrapped it.Awesome did give me something thoughIt taught me about having a header image for your repo. It taught me about having a Code of Conduct and Contributing guidelines and Table of Contents. I worked on that for days.The first iteration in VS CodeTweeting, DEV‚Äôing and hoping for the bestI finished the repo last Friday evening. I tweeted about it:https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev/status/1106678222463340550Hashtagging made all the difference. I specifically targeted the most frequently used hashtags, throwing up a lob and hoping someone would come down for the dunk.I also made a post on DEV talking about it.2 stars become 40I looked shortly after I made the repo public. I had two stars. By night‚Äôs end I had 40.Not bad, not badI woke up and there were 235. I went out with my friends to celebrate one of their birthdays and while out I checked again. 394 stars.I also gained another 22 followers on GitHub.The stars kept comingFour days on and I have over 1300 stars.I also made GitHub trending:Number 3 is not too shabbyI was a ‚Äúpopular‚Äù developer for one dayHow did this happen?I attribute this to a couple of factors.  Riding a wave  A README with personality  Clear CoC and contribution guidelines  Luck  And good old marketingRiding a waveList repos are hot and I don‚Äôt see that slowing down any time soon. I simply rode a wave.README has personalityI wanted it to look a certain way; to be welcoming and have all the emojis I wanted without overdoing it. The header image and ToC really helped.Clear CoC and contributing guidelinesI won‚Äôt tolerate bullsh*t. I also have a clear vision for the repo:  Must be books or articles you‚Äôve read and are good or thought-provoking, which is obviously subjective  Or books and articles recommended to you by other developers, most importantly ones you respect.These are simple quality control metrics and so far the PRs I‚Äôve gotten respect this.LuckSee Riding a wave.Good old marketingThis one is important. I made another tweet about it that made my skin crawl. I really, really dislike selling. But as someone on Twitter pointed out to me:Introverted most of the timeExtroverted for a paycheck.Indeed.Here‚Äôs to the repo‚Äôs health and popularityI have more to add and plan on doing it every weekend.You can find it below.The JavaScript Developer‚Äôs Reading List.",

Then it went to using localStorage and basically static. Then I chose React, different editors, making it an MVP, and now to where I am today.Let‚Äôs back up a bit, however, to sometime last year.Choosing React before even learning it properlyReact was the new hotness in 2017 when I was starting this app. I was still a pretty green web developer and chased a lot of technology, though I am sticking with React for now.I chose a simple React CSS framework to get some sort of semblance of styling up and running, and then I tried to build it.I got stuck. Immediately.At the end of 2017 I was floundering with this app; at the time I was also interning at DEV and had very little time to work on it. But in 2018, after my internship was over, I went on to buy Wes Bos‚Äôs React For Beginners course and dove in.Getting up to speed but still strugglingI got the basics down right away. But, as I said in a recent DEV comment, the tutorial loop is something I stayed stuck in, a complete crutch for my fear of failing. I built components in Check Yo Self basically by looking at Wes‚Äôs code that I was writing and then using snippets to quickly get up and running. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this unless you‚Äôre a junior developer. I was doing some serious copy pasta with the editor and other parts of the app, which is hard to admit.ChangesThe end of last year saw me forgetting the tutorials and building things. I am working on a command utility based on Check Yo Self, and otherinteresting things.I‚Äôm also building dumb React components from scratch to get the hang of how to build them and how they work.New mindsetBuilding the search function for this blog as well as doing some other work in React, especially with this blog, has me thinking in React and JavaScript in general. Reading the React docs is a pleasure and something I started to do last year.I‚Äôve learned how to learn and search for my problems and error messages.I‚Äôve gone to Twitter and asked around.

      "title": "Bugfix: Spelunking in Someone Else's Code",
      "content"	 : "I love CodeSandbox. It has pretty much replaced CodePen for me unless I am fiddling around with CSS or freeCodeCamp front-end projects.I like going through the sandboxes and picking out different ones to look at, take apart, and figure out how they work.While going through React Tutorial for Beginners by Kent C. Dodds on Egghead.io I decided I would look for sandboxes that correlate with the course as I was using Codesandbox to build out the stopwatch we were building in that course.I found a sandbox which I forked and found it to be buggy.Why didn‚Äôt the stopwatch work? Glancing at the code for a few seconds, I saw some obvious problems right away.Here is an example of the stopwatch being broken:Bugfix 1The first thing I noticed was on line 7:class StopWatch extends React.Component {  state = { lapse: 0, running: false };  handleRunClick = () =&amp;gt; {    const startTime = Date.now() - this.state.lapse;    setInterval(() =&amp;gt; {      this.setState({        lapse: Date.now - startTime      });    });    this.setState({      running: true    });  };Date.now() needs parentheses. Date is an an object constructor with .now() being a method. When we click on the start button, React doesn‚Äôt know what to do here; we aren‚Äôt setting the state of lapse to be a number, which we expect. By adding the parentheses, we get the start button to work. No more NaNms.But now we have another problem: the timer won‚Äôt stop.I also removed the console.log(Math.random()); because I felt it was unneeded.Bugfix 2: Getting the Stopwatch to Stop and ClearEach time the button is clicked, we set the state to either running or lapse. The timer runs when we click start but clicking stop or clear doesn‚Äôt seem to work. How can we fix this?We can create a timer update function that accepts the current state. We can accomplish this by using native DOM APIs such as setInterval() and clearInterval(). We can run conditional logic to see if the timer is running://updater functionthis.setState(state =&amp;gt; {  if (state.running) {    clearInterval(this.timer);  } else {    const startTime = Date.now() - this.state.lapse;    this.timer = setInterval(() =&amp;gt; {      this.setState({        lapse: Date.now() - startTime      });    });  }and use Date.now() to get the timestamp in ms, assign it a startTime variable to compare the current time to the amount of time that has passed. When we click the start button, it sets the startTime to the current timestamp. We also need to return a new state as state is not mutable..class StopWatch extends React.Component {  state = { lapse: 0, running: false };  handleRunClick = () =&amp;gt; {    //updater function    this.setState(state =&amp;gt; {      if (state.running) {        clearInterval(this.timer);      } else {        const startTime = Date.now() - this.state.lapse;        this.timer = setInterval(() =&amp;gt; {          this.setState({            lapse: Date.now() - startTime          });        });      }      // returning a new state      // to not mutate our original state      return { running: !state.running };    });  };Okay so this partially works. But as you can see below, if I click clear while the stopwatch timer is running, it doesn‚Äôt clear the timer, and it also doesn‚Äôt allow me to stop the timer, either.How do we fix this particular bug?If we look back at the previous code, we can see we are using clearInterval() to reset the stopwatch timer. In our current iteration, our handleOnClear method is just setting the state without clearing the previous state.handleOnClear = () =&amp;gt; {  this.setState({    lapse: 0,    running: false  });};We can fix this by adding clearInterval() and passing in the timer function to the handleOnClear method to clear the state.handleOnClear = () =&amp;gt; {  clearInterval(this.timer);  this.setState({    lapse: 0,    running: false  });};This will give us the results we want.Potential Problem?There is a memory leak in this particular iteration. The timer will run until it is explicitly stopped in the DOM. We can use a React lifecycle method to stop all processes in the DOM when this component is mounted or unmounted.For this we can use componentWillUnmount to tell React to unmount the component once it is done rendering.componentWillUnmount() {  clearInterval(this.timer);}Thoughts and ConclusionsI find it much more enjoyable fixing other people‚Äôs bugs than my own. This was a fun exercise and I plan on doing it more regularly and blogging about it.This stopwatch is a stupid simple component but if you are just scratching the surface of React like me, I am sure digging into something like this stopwatch and figuring out how it works is an excellent exercise and use of one‚Äôs time.Sign Up for the Newsletter.

      "title": "Big O Notation",
      "content"	 : "Big O: How to Determine the Efficeiency of Some FunctionTo determine what the the efficiency of some function is, first we have to clarify what we mean by efficient.Do we mean:  Faster?  Less memory intensive?  Easy to read?Let‚Äôs break these three concepts down into a little more detail.Why Faster is Not the Optimal Measure of Efficiency  There are lots of moving parts in a computer, literally and figuratively. What works on my machine may not work on yours. Processor speed, available memory, all these constraints have an effect on the time it takes to process an operation.  There are a million little processes going on in your own computer effecting the time it takes to complete each operation. Maybe your Mac is processing an app with a bunch of nested for loops on a Wednesday afternoon which takes 50 ms. Later that day the same code processes in 200ms. We can‚Äôt depend on time as a metric because of the large amount of variables we need to consider when we talk about our computers and their processing power.So How Do We Measure an Algorithms Effiecency?By the number of simple operations it needs to perform.Take a look at this code:function doSomeMath(n) {  return n * (n + 1) / 2;}Here we have three simple operations:  1 multiplication  1 addition  1 divisionThis is the case regardless of n‚Äôs size.Take a look at this code:function plsIterateOverMe(n) {  let count = 0;  for (let i =1; i &amp;lt;= n; i++) {    count += 1;  }  return count;}How many operations are there here?We have:let total = 0: 1 assignmentlet i = 1: 1 assignmentcount += 1: n additions and n assignmentsi &amp;lt;= n: n comparisonsi++: n additions and assignmentsDepending on the operations we count the number of operations can be from 2n up to 5n + 2.Regardless of the exact number of operations the number of operations grows proportionally with n.If n doubles the number of operations will too.This is essentially Big O Notation: a way of discerning the runtime of an algorithm as its input grows.It doesn‚Äôt matter what the inputs are, only the trends we can see when we assessing an algorithms efficiency.Technical Definition  We say that an algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer must do is eventually less than the constant times f(n) as n increases.  f(n) could be linear: (f(n)=n) or O(n)  f(n) could be quadratic: (f(n) = n^2) or O(n^2)  f(n) could be constant: (f(n) = 1) or O(1)  or‚Ä¶f(n) could be something else.Let‚Äôs refer back to our previous doSomeMath funtion.function doSomeMath(n) {  return n * (n + 1) / 2;}This is always only 3 operations. This is O(1) or constant time.And our plsIterateOverMe function:function plsIterateOverMe(n) {  let count = 0;  for (let i =1; i &amp;lt;= n; i++) {    count += 1;  }  return count;}Number of operations will eventually be bound by a multiple of n, maybe 8n or something. It doesn‚Äôt really matter. This is linear time, or O(n)Here is an example of a slower, less efficient algorithm:function addAllPairs(n) {  for (var i =0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) {    for (var j = 0; j &amp;lt; n; j++) {      console.log(i + j);    }  }}Here we have an O(n) operation inside another one, giving us, O(n^2).The important thing is that constants don‚Äôt matter here. Neither do smaller terms such as O(n -3) which is O(n) or O(n^2 + 12n + 6) which is O(n^2).Things to Remember  Arithmetic operations are constant  Variable assignment is constant  Accessing elements in an array or object is constant  A loop‚Äôs complexity is the length of the loop times whatever is inside the loopConclusionBig O has some interesting math behind it but at the end of the day, recognizing different patterns in your algorithm, such as nested loops, should give you a head start on optimizing an algorithm for efficiency.",

      "content"	 : "  This is a new series where I review a programming book I have read. I will usually issue a review within a few days of reading it. This one is late because I just decided to do this series.First, let me say that I am a big fan of Kyle Simpson‚Äôs pragmatic teaching style. I read You Don‚Äôt Know JS: Up &amp;amp; Going a couple years ago and it changed my understanding of JavaScript at that time.Since reading that book1 I have a more solid grasp on JavaScript fundamentals than ever before. I expected to learn something that I had been missing in learning those fundamentals and I did. However I was disappointed in Kyle‚Äôs dogmatism about const, let and var and how and when to use them.This was an issue in the first book as well. I understand some of the quirks when using syntactic sugar such as let and const especially when destructuring arrays. But we are far safer for them than we are without them.Here is a bit of what I am talking about on this issue:just realized a quirky limitation of let/const that doesn&amp;#39;t apply to var:var [ a = 1, a = 2 ] = foo() // oklet [ b = 1, b = 2 ] = bar() // errorlet c; [ c = 1, c = 2 ] = baz() // ok&amp;mdash; getify (@getify) October 4, 2018This is a legitimate concern. But the conversation that followed made me question Kyle‚Äôs openness to new ideas:i think you all overeached a bit in trying to save us from these &amp;quot;errors&amp;quot; -- which aren&amp;#39;t actually errors. that kind of stuff is useful from opt-in linters. but the language shouldn&amp;#39;t have been so opinionated. shrugs.&amp;mdash; getify (@getify) October 4, 2018Opposing ViewpointsBen Lesh, who is a fantastic champion of RxJS and functional programming tweeted this:Most respectable linters disallow var anyway. ü§îAnd I&amp;#39;m with @awbjs, const and let are saving us here, I&amp;#39;ve seen and even written this bug with var in my 20+ years. I guess I&amp;#39;m just not awesome. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&amp;mdash; Ben Lesh üß¢üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíªüé® (@BenLesh) October 4, 2018Admittedly, he could have avoided the passive aggressive jab at Kyle at the end but I agreed with this tweet.JavaScript is a wild language that was written with some poor design choices. To ignore that fact is fatal; I don‚Äôt think you can teach someone fundamentals without pointing out these design choices that make JavaScript sometimes hard to work with.JavaScript is a beautiful language. I enjoy writing it. And I learned more technical lessons about the language I love by reading this book. But, the concepts in the book are sometimes obfuscated by Kyle‚Äôs dogmatic insistence on old conventions. I don‚Äôt think he is aware how it comes across to people like me with intermediate skills trying to become more technical. It detracted from an otherwise crucial book to read when learning JS.            That‚Äôs the first in the series.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

This is dangerous for your mental health, productivity, and prospective employers.I began to feel stifled and overwhelmed by the scope of the projects I was creating‚Ä¶until recently.Dan Abramov at JSConf 2018This talk by Dan Abramov opened my eyes to React and JavaScript. It helped me to clear out a lot of the burden I was carrying by trying to create the perfect app/tool.Dan Abramov on TwitterRecently, Dan tweeted something which led me to scrap all the extra features in my apps. and coming up with a smaller concept to ship called an MVP.First years of programming were really hard. I was confused for a long time. But I remembered how I got through it. It‚Äôs the feeling of getting excited ‚Äî like an itch or buzz in your head. Seeing things coming together before they‚Äôre real. I remembered because I feel it again.&amp;mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) September 1, 2018I&amp;#39;ve been programming for about 14 years, about 8 of them professionally. I&amp;#39;m a slow learner though.&amp;mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) September 1, 2018So What is an MVP?MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. This is an app with a small set of features you ship to have something ready to consume.An MVP helps new developers fill their portfolios with meaningful projects. This will help them stand out from other new developers. This is if the code is clean, well structured, and the project is functional.You can always iterate on the MVP instead of trying to perfect a project: no software project is perfect. You might as well ship.Pick an MVP and Open Source ItOpen Source is not some fad that software engineers are fanatic about. It is the lifeblood of software development today.Using an open-source platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket1 will showcase to prospective employers what you are working on. It also shows how well you‚Äôre doing with what you‚Äôre working on, and it also shows growth and your learning process2.Open Source But Don‚Äôt Go Star ChasingA lot of times, new developers, myself included, want to hit it big on GitHub and get thousands of stars on a project and make the trending repositories list.Stop. It‚Äôs definitely a trap.via GIPHYHaving a popular repo on GitHub is rare; there are 350 million+ users on GitHub and even more repositories. The odds are against you, at least at first.Getting your feet wet in open source, building your skills, is the best thing you can do when you‚Äôre starting out. Once you get a feel for open source, you can build something more significant. If the developer community finds it interesting, the stars will come.Learn in PublicShawn Wang is a popular React developer at Netlify. He tweeted the phrase learn in public which encapsulates what I mean when I say you should open source your MVP:Learn In Public. pic.twitter.com/RpKfRAy9Um&amp;mdash; shawn swyx wang üá∏üá¨ (@swyx) June 19, 2018Learning and failing in public is an important part of getting your work noticed. The more you iterate and share, the more visible you are to prospective employers. This is why it is important to get something out the door.Experiencing PerfectionismI wanted my current app, Check Yo Self to be a beautiful, full stack environment to check your markdown blog posts. It went through many iterations but, I stalled on building it. Every shiny new thing I wanted to add to it to make it perfect overwhelmed me; it was crippling.I have been working on this app for a year and a half, almost two years now. It should be, considering its simple premise, finished. The scope creep, the feeling that it needed to look better than similar apps left me paralyzed. I was unable to work on it. It killed my productivity and I stopped working on it for months.After watching Dan‚Äôs talk and reading his tweets, I decided that I should build a few features. Then, after they‚Äôre built, I can iterate on it.¬†¬†¬† via GIPHY¬†¬†¬†        Let&#39;s Go.    I am also working on a CLI tool. I have been working on that for 8 months now and it‚Äôs taken that long for the same reason.I stripped all the extra options and have been working on it for the past few days.Considering all the small npm tools out there, I can make a tool with a couple small functions that are useful. That‚Äôs it.This relieved a lot of the stress I was feeling over the course of the past year. Now I knew I could ship something and not have the weight of abandoned repos littering my GitHub profile.ConclusionYou can build pretty much anything you want, even if it there are similar tools out there. You have a unique perspective and you can bring that to a project that someone else has built. You‚Äôll build it in a different way.Get set up on GitHub, create a repo, get a little documentation set up for it, and share it on Twitter, LinkedIn, Hacker News, wherever.You‚Äôll then have something to add to your portfolio and resume to be proud of. You can always build on top of what you have later.            I‚Äôd choose GitHub over all the other ones. It is the de facto standard currently. Most employers who look for open source contributions do so at GitHub.¬†&amp;#8617;              There‚Äôs a lot of debate about having your GitHub be a requirement for a software engineering position. If you work 9-5, have a family and other obligations, open sourcing side projects or side projects in general, will not be something you‚Äôre able to do. Contributing to open source would be difficult as well. It is something new developers should look into, regardless.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

There are a lot of interesting plugins but I use just a fraction of them, which you place in your .zshrc profile:plugins=(git dirhistory brew dircycle gitfast git-extras jsontools node npm osx repo sudo urltools web-search dirpersist history-substring-search last-working-dir safe-paste yarn zsh-completions)Plugins extend the functionality of not only bash but git as well.Zsh AliasesAliases are a hot topic in the dev community. Do you use them or don‚Äôt you? This depends on your experience and personal preferences, in my opinion, so there is really no right or wrong answers.Aliases allow you to type a few letters to initiate a command in your terminal. For instance, I have this to push to git: gp.Some of my favorite aliases:alias hero=&#39;git push heroku master&#39;alias takecare=&#39;tiny-care-terminal&#39;alias bsync=&#39;browser-sync start --server&#39;alias breload=&#39;browser-sync reload&#39;alias jopt=&#39;jpeg-recompress --accurate --quality medium --min 40&#39;alias popt=&#39;pngcrush -brute&#39;alias jekstw=&#39;bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0&#39;alias jeksth=&#39;bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4001 --host 0.0.0.0&#39;alias jeksd=&#39;bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4002 --host 0.0.0.0&#39;alias gitor=&#39;git remote add origin&#39;alias pushit=&#39;git push -u origin master&#39;alias ls=&#39;colorls --dark --sort-dirs --report -A --gs&#39;alias lc=&#39;colorls --tree --dark -A&#39;Zsh ThemesThis is my favorite part of all this.You can add a zsh theme by downloading it from the creator‚Äôs repo or just find one in Robby Russell‚Äôs repo.The default theme is robbyrussell.zsh-theme but you can install pretty much anything you like. You install a theme in your .zshrc file as follows:ZSH_THEME=&quot;robbyrussell&quot;Here is what I was working with a few days ago:¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†       Wes Bos&#39;s Cobalt2 theme    This is a theme that uses Powerline Patched Fonts for the flag and iconography. This was my setup for a long time until I read Ali‚Äôs post. That post turned me on to a theme I already tried but was so used to Cobalt2 for everything2 I decided to switch it back.But taking a look at her setup inspired me to take the leap. And now I am working with this:I also learned how to open different panes in one iTerm window reading that post. I have five panes open on my external monitor:But I Didn‚Äôt Stop ThereI wanted to use other iconography than the default spaceship icons because for whatever reason I couldn‚Äôt get them to work.As I read the issues for spaceship, I found an issue about changing the glyphs to Nerd Fonts. After reading You‚Äôre Missing Out on a Better Mac Terminal Experience on Medium I figured out how to get them to work.Using spaceship‚Äôs customizations I ended up with the headphone and flash glyphs instead of my machine name for the terminal prefix.Here are some of the customizations I made:SPACESHIP_PROMPT_ADD_NEWLINE=&quot;true&quot;SPACESHIP_CHAR_SYMBOL=&quot;uf0e7&quot;SPACESHIP_CHAR_PREFIX=&quot;uf025 &quot;SPACESHIP_CHAR_SUFFIX=&quot; &quot;SPACESHIP_CHAR_COLOR_SUCCESS=yellowSPACESHIP_PROMPT_DEFAULT_PREFIX=&quot;$USER&quot;SPACESHIP_PROMPT_FIRST_PREFIX_SHOW=&quot;true&quot;SPACESHIP_USER_SHOW=&quot;true&quot;# NODESPACESHIP_NODE_PREFIX=&quot;node:(&quot;SPACESHIP_NODE_SUFFIX=&quot;) &quot;SPACESHIP_NODE_SYMBOL=&quot;uf898 &quot;In that article, it mentions colorls which is a Ruby script that will let you add icons for folders, etc and change the colors of your ls command. After some fiddling, I got it to work:¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†        Tree view    ¬†¬†¬† ¬†¬†¬†        List view with git statuses turned on    Other PluginsZsh Syntax HighlightingI use zsh-syntax-highlighting to highlight directories and other commands in the terminal. You can customize the color of the highlights by looking at the highlighter docs.Z - Jump Aroundz is a utility that allows you to jump to different directories by typing z and then the directory. You‚Äôll have to cd around in directories for a bit to ‚Äútrain‚Äù it but once you do, it‚Äôs pretty easy to skip around in directories. It is a ‚Äúfrecent‚Äù tool: frequent and recent directories.Exa: ls replacementThis command line utility is exa, which replaces ls with some nifty features is something I don‚Äôt really use now that I have installed colorls. You can type exa and it will list the contents of your directory. You can get directory permissions, print each item on one line with the -1 flag, and other custom controls.What Is Your Setup?Want to share your setup? Send me a tweet.            You can install other tools like Fish shell, but zsh is probably the most widely used, outside of bash itself.¬†&amp;#8617;              Slack, VSCode, Alfred‚Ä¶¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

      "content"	 : "One of the biggest lessons I am trying to learn as a mid-level dev is keeping my code simple.I was working on a few algorithms for a bootcamp I planned to attend1.I tweeted this algorithm I was stuck on a couple weeks ago:Need a bit of help here? Usually the Slack channels I am on are all asleep by now. üòè pic.twitter.com/5sALYO4cjN&amp;mdash; Tiffany White ü§®‚öõÔ∏è (@TiffanyW_412) June 25, 2018Clean two-liner. Nice, right?Let‚Äôs take a look below:function longestString(strs) {  // is x string length greater than y string length? If so  // return x  // if not return y  // add an empty string as an accumulator  // as a callback to the reduce function  const longest = strs.reduce((x, y) =&amp;gt; x.length &amp;gt;= y.length ? x : y, &#39;&#39; );  return longest;}Here I am trying to get the longest string in an array. I thought I could accomplish this easily with a functional array method so I searched around. I read the MDN for map, filter and reduce to jog my memory, and then settled on reduce.Someone on StackOverflow had a similar algorithm they were trying to solve. I adapted my algorithm based on that.As the Twitter embed shows I had a bit of trouble with the comparison as my test wasn‚Äôt passing. I added the appropriate operator and all was well.This is as clean as it gets.But is it readable?Mentors Are GreatA friend of mine and mentor DM‚Äôd me on Twitter about this and the solutions people offered me on Twitter. He said that one solution was a mess and that if he had written anything like that he would have gotten chewed out by his boss.My immediate response was to chuckle at the guy who gave me the nested ternary.But he wasn‚Äôt talking about that. He was talking about my clever two liner. Well‚Ä¶A Lesson in Dumb CodeMy friend and I talked at length about cleverness and writing code for other humans to read. The variables I use in the two line solution don‚Äôt have any context. Instead, I should have broken them out into something like this:let lenX = str1.length;let lenY = str2.length;const longest = strs.reduce((str1, str2) =&amp;gt; lenX &amp;gt;= lenY ? str1 : str2, &#39;&#39;);This is still terse but more readable and easier to understand.I could have used a traditional for loop but wanted to look in the know and get in easily2. I wanted to look clever and smart and in the process made the code unreadable, the hallmark of a mid-level dev.Keep It Simple, StupidWhen I was a newbie dev, I never understood why anyone would write a variable declaration like x or y. I disliked functional programming methods like reduce for that reason: most examples I found used these variables. I never understood what x was referencing. As someone who better understands the language I have fallen into that clever mid-level trap. Don‚Äôt do it. While yes, it makes you look as if you know what you‚Äôre doing, it also makes the code unreadable and you start to look less and less appealing as a potential dev candidate for X company.As a friend of mine used to say:Keep it simple, stupid.            You should definitely not apply or attend.¬†&amp;#8617;              I could have gotten in regardless. Their practices are predatory.

    "what-are-props": {
      "title": "What Are Components and Props?",
      "content"	 : "In order to understand how React renders the UI, we need to understand two crucial elements to a React application: components and props. Each of these elements allow you to reuse pieces of your application and think about each piece in isolation of the others.What Are Components?Components are basically functions. You can use a JavaScript function1 or a class based component in order to return React elements rendering what should be displayed on the screen.Each component takes a prop which is just some input given to a React component.Functional Component Examplefunction Hello(props) {  return &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello, {props.name}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;;}This is valid because it accepts one prop2 object argument and returns a React element.Example of a Class Based Componentclass Hello extends React.Component {  render() {    return &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello, {this.props.name}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;  }}Class components have extra functionality that I will cover in another article. For now, this is how you create functional and class based components.Rendering a ComponentYou can create user defined components in React. For example:const element = &amp;lt;Hello name=&quot;World&quot; /&amp;gt;;This is an example of JSX helping React create elements to be rendered to the DOM. When React sees this user-defined component, it will pass the JSX attributes to the component as a single object called props. You can think of a prop like an HTML attribute, for example:&amp;lt;form action=&quot;&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; class=&quot;form-example&quot;&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;div class=&quot;form-example&quot;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;!-- Where &quot;name&quot; is an HTML attribute where it gives the label element some input --&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&amp;gt;Enter your name: &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; required&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;div class=&quot;form-example&quot;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&amp;gt;Enter your email: &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; name=&quot;email&quot; id=&quot;email&quot; required&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;div class=&quot;form-example&quot;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Subscribe!&quot;&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;Here, we render ‚ÄúHello, World‚Äù on the page:function Hello(props) {  return &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello, {props.name}&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;;}const element = &amp;lt;Hello name=&quot;World&quot; /&amp;gt;;React.DOM.render(  element,  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;));Here we are taking the React component Hello and rendering it using ReactDOM.render() with {name: &#39;World&#39;} as the props.Props Should Never Be ChangedA component‚Äôs props should never mutate. While React is pretty flexible about this, you should always use a ‚Äúpure‚Äù function, something like:function multiply(x, y) {  return x * y;}This function is ‚Äúpure‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt change its inputs and will alway return the same result.Note that ‚Äúimpure‚Äù functions mutate their own output:function accumulate(account, getMoney) {  account.total += getMoney;}React has a pretty steadfast rule:All React components should not change their inputs.If you want to accomplish something like this, you will have to use state. That is for another blog post, however.            Called a functional component¬†&amp;#8617;              Which stands for properties.

I want to share some observations on doing a CLI tool and how to be more prepared to write one than me.Getting to Know Your BasicsI have stumbled a bit on this project with basic JavaScript which I am embarrassed to admit. The issue for me is never writing a tool like this and also setting impossible standards. GitHub star chasing is not a way to start a project. You will never finish it and, you won‚Äôt be reaching 1,000 stars or more, especially on your first try. The ones that do that are few and far between. Know about arrays1, array methods, and the arguments before starting and if you do, try not to overthink things. This is what I am doing and it will stop you dead in your tracks.Read the Docs to Your Modules. Then Read Them Again. And Again.I cannot stress this enough. It took several read-throughs to understand what I was looking at and how I could use the APIs. If a library seems convoluted and hard to use, find a simpler library. Reading the docs is important to understanding the library author‚Äôs APIs and affordances which will make it a tad bit easier to write your own library.Don‚Äôt Be Afraid to Ask the Library Author How to Use SomethingI still have a hard time with this. I have been struggling with routing the components on the hamburger icon on Check Yo Self. It took me an embarrassingly long time to ask the library author for guidance. I made the offer a bit sweeter for him by explaining his docs weren‚Äôt friendly to newcomers and if he had time to help me I could help him by writing better docs for the project. I just did this tonight. We will see what the outcome of this is.Have FunIn the end, you‚Äôre building a project, learning about open source, and building a portfolio for potential employers. Don‚Äôt sweat the small stuff and have fun building your tool.            I know all of this.

      "title": "What Is React Reconciliation?",
      "content"	 : "Photo by Anthony DELANOIX on Unsplash  This is an update to this article because of input by Dan Abramov. Thanks Dan!In order for React to be as fast as it is, it only needs to update the parts of the DOM that need it. You really don‚Äôt need to worry about doing this yourself, but understanding how setState() in React works could be beneficial.The render() FunctionThe render() function in React creates a tree of React elements. When you pass props down and those props update, the render() function returns a different tree of elements. When a component‚Äôs state changes, React calls the component‚Äôs render method to get a tree of elements it wants to render. This tree is sometimes called the ‚Äúvirtual DOM‚Äù. React also remembers the previous rendered element tree, so it can compare the new and the old version to figure out what needs to change in the actual DOM, and performs these changes.Take this code from CSS-Tricks:class App extends React.Component {  state = {    result: &#39;&#39;,    entry1: &#39;&#39;,    entry2: &#39;&#39;  }  handleEntry1 = (event) =&amp;gt; {    this.setState({entry1: event.target.value})  }  handleEntry2 = (event) =&amp;gt; {    this.setState({entry2: event.target.value})  }  handleAddition = (event) =&amp;gt; {    const firstInt = parseInt(this.state.entry1)    const secondInt = parseInt(this.state.entry2)    this.setState({result: firstInt + secondInt })  }  render() {    const { entry1, entry2, result } = this.state    return(      &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Entry 1: { entry1 }&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Entry 2: { entry2 }&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Result: { result }&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;          Entry 1:          &amp;lt;input type=&#39;text&#39; onChange={this.handleEntry1} /&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;          Entry 2:          &amp;lt;input type=&#39;text&#39; onChange={this.handleEntry2} /&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;button onClick={this.handleAddition} type=&#39;submit&#39;&amp;gt;Add&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;    )  }}We set up the initial state to an object which will expect some input. This is the App component. When an input is captured in the entry field, React will create a new tree of elements that will contain the new state for entry1. React will compare the new tree of elements with the old one to figure out what needs to change in the actual DOM, and performs these changes.A new tree of elements is created each time state changes in the App component.Mounting/Unmounting on State ChangeReact will attempt to preserve the existing DOM tree so input state would not get destroyed. State changes trigger reconciliation. During reconciliation, React compares the trees to decide what to keep or mount and unmount.To get an example of this, check out this pen I forked below:See the Pen reconciliation-2 Pen by Tiffany White (@twhite96) on CodePen.Why This MattersThe way React handles state and state changes makes it really fast. You‚Äôll need to be careful to adhere to its heuristics and conventions or else performance will degrade. With that said, it is pretty easy to build a performant app in React.Wrapping Things UpThere are a few things I didn‚Äôt go over in this article but I suggest you read the React docs on reconciliation.If you like the blog, you‚Äôll love the newsletter: little letters to you.",

      "title": "How to Bind this in React Without a Constructor
",
      "content"	 : "this in React is a reference to the current component. Usually this in React is bound to its built-in methods so that when you want to update state or use an event handler on a form, you could do something like this:&amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; ref={this.someInput} required placeholder=&quot;This is a Method&quot; defaultValue={getSomeMethod()}/&amp;gt;where this.someInput is passing state to whichever React component you are rendering.Unfortunately, though, React doesn‚Äôt auto-bind this to custom methods. This means if I wanted to manipulate the DOM by getting some input, which you can‚Äôt do as you can with normal JavaScript, I would create a ref to do whatever DOM tinkering I wanted.But because React doesn‚Äôt auto-bind this, the following code would output undefined when logged:someInput = React.createRef();  renderSomeInput (event) {    event.preventDefault();    const someFunction = this.someInput.value.value;    console.log(this);  }In order to avoid this, we could use the constructor function in order to initialize or get the state we want:class SomeCompenent extends React.Component {  constructor() {    super();    this.renderSomeInput.bind(this);  }}While this is a decent way to initialize state, what if you wanted to bind several custom methods in one component? It would get pretty messy‚Ä¶class SomeCompenent extends React.Component {  constructor() {    super();    this.renderSomeInput.bind(this);    this.renderSomeInput.bind(this);    this.renderSomeInput.bind(this);    this.renderSomeInput.bind(this);   }}You get the idea.Instead, we can bind this to custom React methods by declaring a method and assigning it to an arrow function:class SomeCompenent extends React.Component {  someInput = React.createRef();    renderSomeInput = (event) =&amp;gt;  {    event.preventDefault();    const someFunction = this.someInput.value.value;    console.log(this);    }  }which will allow us to bind the value of this to the SomeComponent component.",

Destructuring is a way to extract values from nested arrays and objects.When you use destructuring, you are taking a JavaScript expression and extracting data from either arrays, objects, maps, and sets into their own variable. It also allows you to extract properties on an object or items from an array in multiples.Examplesconst car = {  make: &#39;Subaru&#39;,  model: &#39;BRZ&#39;,  year: &#39;2018&#39;,  dealership: &#39;Cochran&#39;,  city: &#39;Pittsburgh&#39;};const make = car.make;const model = car.model;In this example, we have some pretty repetitive code where we need to create a variable from some value inside of an object.Instead of creating multiple variables, we can destructure them to a single, sweet line:const {  make, model } = car;where we get a variable called make and a variable called model extract them from the car object and putting them into their own variables which are scoped to the parent block, in this case, the window since they aren‚Äôt in a nested object.If I wanted to add another property to the destructured object, I could do something like this:const { make, model, year } = car;where we get a top level variable inside our scope.This is a good use of destructuring, but what if we want to get at data in nested arrays and objects?Take this data we get from some web API:const weather = {  city: &#39;Pittsburgh&#39;,  state: &#39;Pennsylvania&#39;,  local: {    precipitation: {      snowing: yes,      raining: no,    },    coordinates: {      lat: &#39;40.4406¬∞ N&#39;,      long: &#39;79.9959¬∞ W&#39;    }  }};I just want the latitude and longitude in this case. I could do:const lat = weather.local.coordinates.lat;const long = weather.local.cooridinates.long;but this is not easy to reason about.Destructuring to the rescue:const { lat, long } = weather.local.coordinates;console.log(lat, long);In this instance we need to destructure weather.local.coordinates because we are destructuring an object a few levels deep.Other Fun StuffYou can also rename and destructure variables in ES6.How?const snowing = &#39;no&#39;;const weather = {  city: &#39;Pittsburgh&#39;,  state: &#39;Pennsylvania&#39;,  local: {    precipitation: {      snowing: &#39;yes&#39;,      raining: &#39;no&#39;,    },    coordinates: {      lat: &#39;40.4406¬∞ N&#39;,      long: &#39;79.9959¬∞ W&#39;    }  }};Here I already have a snowing variable. I also have a snowing key on the same object. You aren‚Äôt able to do this, however, so you will need to rename the variable or the key within the object. In this instance, we can rename the snowing property to snow and the raining property to rain.const { snowing: snow, raining: rain } = weather.local.precipitaton;This will assign weather.local.precipitaton to a variable called snow and also to a variable called rain.",

I may be a junior but I have more experience than when I first started, last year even.It was very helpful to write about the journey but now it‚Äôs time to move on. Thanks for coming along for the ride.            I am just getting my programming mojo back. The failed internship really couched me. I am working on a few freeCodeCamp intermediate projects to get the juices flowing again.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

    "2017-wrap-up-and-2018-goals": {
      "title": "2017 Wrap-up and 2018 Goals",
      "content"	 : "Wrapping up a year is never a thing one wants to do. At least I don‚Äôt.2017 was an amazing year; I built a full-stack app I was proud of with a course and started another. I was a perfect 12/12 months of blogging for the second year in a row. And, at the end of the year I scored an internship with The Practical Dev.The beginning of this year has been the total opposite: I am being evicted as my apartment building is renovating and will not be renewing my lease and the shine of the internship has worn off as I struggle to find a place to live and get moved. I‚Äôve made some pretty horrendous errors in the face of all this, after a strong start. I am probably not getting offered. I am okay with it now but wasn‚Äôt when I got my 2/3 of the way performance review. I was super depressed for a week or two.But this is not what I want to talk about. I want to recap the year and look ahead for this one and what I can do after I move to turn things around.2017 Highs After 2016 LowsIsn‚Äôt it how it always is though?The Good:  I completed a full course on web development without a break. I went through the colossal Web Developer Bootcamp with Colt Steele and built YelpCamp which I am not really developing anymore but am tweaking a bit here and there.  I started my own full-stack JavaScript app called Check Yo Self which is still in active development. If I am without a position for a little bit while I get settled into my new place so be it. I‚Äôll continue to work on this app.  I got offered the dev.to internship.  I gained 300 Twitter followers which opened up a whole new network to me I didn‚Äôt have previously. This has been a boon to my job search.  I was on the Developer on Fire Podcast. It was super fun talking to Dave Rael again.The Bad:  Couldn‚Äôt finish school.  That‚Äôs it!Goals for 2018I am currently looking for positions outside of dev.to. I enjoyed my time there but if I am being honest the way I utterly messed up after they gave me a chance‚Ä¶not even sure if I can look them in the face. I will have to, but it will be hard. Really hard1.I am not a quitter though so while this is a setback it is a minor one and thanks to my friends and mentors Craig Lang and Pablo Rivera I am not dangling off the edge as much as I was. They‚Äôve been instrumental in lifting my spirits.Without further ado, goals.  Get hired as a junior developer working with a primarily JavaScript stack. Rails is okay as I built a Blog app in it, simple CRUD without auth or limiting certain interactions with certain users2. I‚Äôd prefer JavaScript though as I am more familiar with it3.  Move to a nicer home. This place is shite. So I am glad I need to move. It is just finding a place within the amount of time I am allotted that is the issue.  Stop worrying about vanity metrics for the blog. Pablo explained to me that if I‚Äôm not selling anything, looking at my analytics isn‚Äôt going to do anything for me. Traffic without a product is all but meaningless.  Learn: React, Redux, Angular, Typescript, Vue, Vuex, built-in JavaScript APIs and other JavaScript frameworks. I just bought Wes Bos‚Äôs React for Beginners course and am excited to dig into it.  Gain another 300 followers.  Finish Check Yo Self. I need to find time to work on side projects without burning out.  Create some interesting and useful libraries and open source them. This will be interesting considering everything I hear about women getting shut down in open source. We‚Äôll see.  Dive more into animations with CSS and WebAnimations API.There Are Probably MoreBut I am tired and can‚Äôt think of them right now. These are the main things I want to get done this year.            Saying that made me start to cry. I‚Äôve been crying a lot lately. It‚Äôs been really hard to know your shot at developing full time is dashed for a bit. I‚Äôm down, but not out.¬†&amp;#8617;              For instance, anyone can delete a post by any user. Any user can delete a user. It was basically just an exercise for me to show I can navigate around a Rails app and am able to use my theoretical knowledge of OOP and MVC to a real world app.¬†&amp;#8617;              I plan on learning other stacks as well. Learning Rails has been a fun experience even though it isn‚Äôt my preference.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

      "title": "JavaScript Template Literals",
      "content"	 : "Photo credit by HongkiatTraditionally, strings in JavaScript were limited, especially if you were working in languages like Ruby and Python. In both of those languages string interpolation meant that you could substitute strings and have multiline string concatenation without wonky hacks.In JavaScript, there wasn‚Äôt anything like this until ES6. Now, we have JavaScript Template Literals or template strings.SyntaxTemplate strings use back-ticks rather than quotes to denote a string. A template string could look like this:let hello = `Hello World!`;String SubstitutionsWhat‚Äôs nice about string substitutions is that you can take any JavaScript expression and place it inside a Template Literal and it will be output as part of the string.The syntax for this:let name = ‚ÄúTiffany‚Äù;console.log(`Hey, ${name}!`);Since string substitutions in Template Literals are JavaScript expressions we can evaluate any type of expression we want in the Template Literal. We can evaluate a mathematical expression such as:let a = 13;let b = 20;console.log(`The Mac first launched ${a+b} years ago. I, for one, welcome my bitten fruit overlord.`);//  =&amp;gt; The Mac launched 33 years ago. I, for one, welcome my bitten fruit overlord.console.log(`I am old, but not ${2 * (a+b)} yet.`);//  =&amp;gt; I am old, but not 66 yet.// I know. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Bear with my pitiful examples.You can even put functions or method calls inside a Template Literal:// Functions inside expressionsfunction func() {  return ‚ÄúI am the result of foo‚Äù  }console.log(`bar ${func} baz.`);// =&amp;gt; I am the result of foo bar baz.//Method callslet hacker = {name: ‚ÄòElliot Anderson‚Äô}console.log(`You forgot to quit Vim, ${hacker.name.toUpperCase()}`);// =&amp;gt; You forgot to quit Vim, ELLIOT ALDERSONMultiline StringsMultiline strings in JavaScript required hacks like the backslash hack and string concatenation like:let greeting = ‚ÄúHello ‚Äú +‚ÄúWorld‚Äù;Template strings make this a whole lot easier. Add new lines where you need them and the whitespace inside the backticks inside the Template Literal will be included inside the string like so:console.log(`I&#39;m a string on one lineI‚Äôm a string on another line`);Tagged TemplatesTagged Templates can be used for powerful string transformations. You create a Tagged Template by placing a function name before the template string. Here‚Äôs an example of auto escaping an HTML function such that:html`&amp;lt;p title:=&quot;${title:}&quot;&amp;gt;Hello ${name}!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;`returns a string with the appropriate variables substituted but with all the unsafe characters replaced.Nicholas Zakas goes over this in detail in his book Understanding ES6.SummaryTemplate Literals or Template Strings are a powerful addition to the JavaScript language that brings it much needed string interpolation and transformation.Template Literals or Template Strings are a powerful addition to the JavaScript language that brings it much needed string interpolation and transformation.",

The syntax looks a bit like:let a = [4, 5, 6];let b = [7, ‚Ä¶a, 8];console.log(b);This will give us:The spread operator replaces the concat function in ES5:‚Äúuse strict‚Äú;var a = [4, 5, 6];var b = [7].concat(a, [8]);console.log(b);This is a great little feature, but what can we do with it?Some Uses for the Spread OperatorWe can do a lot with the spread operator.Combine ArraysYou can use the spread operator to combine arrays:let test = () =&amp;amp;gt; {  let arr1 = [&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;,&#39;baz&#39;];  let arr2 = [&#39;fizz&#39;, &#39;buzz&#39;];  arr1.push(...arr2); // Will append the contents of arr2 to arr1};test(); // Runs functionCopying ArraysWe‚Äôve used Array.prototype.slice to make copies of arrays. Now we can do that with the spread operator.let arr = [7, 8, 9];let arr2 = [‚Ä¶arr];arr2.push(10); // Will return a deep copy of the array with 10 appended to the end//of the valuesMore At the MDNYou can find more uses for the spread operator at the MDN.",

She would then retweet it to her large following of potential employers and companies.I did:https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412/status/923000005035724800And awesome‚Ä¶things‚Ä¶started‚Ä¶happening.That‚Äôs all I can really say but I have honestly just been trying to process what is happening and how, when it comes together and tries, the tech community is the best there is‚Ä¶",

Here are some of my thoughts on the process.Reviewing the BasicsA lot of what I learned in the beginning was a refresher on topics I have already learned.

Listless, I went to the #jobs channel.Scrolling through all the positions I found one that intrigued me: a JavaScript developer position. Great!, I thought. Just what I want.The job posting was by a company I found three years ago 1 when I wanted to be UX girl. I remembered their unique logo and branding and dug into their site back then. I wasn‚Äôt ready for a job yet but I did remember them.I applied right away.The application process was simple. Upload your resume, tell us why you want to work for us, drop your links in this box. I did all that. Up until I applied I had gotten 3 rejections for positions I‚Äôd applied for. I knew I had a shot at getting an interview with this company.Emails Sometimes Get Lost‚Ä¶I have a habit of checking my email too much. After discovering important emails were ending up ‚ÄúAll Mail‚Äù in my G Suite account, I would go in there daily to see what I had missed.Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt see the initial email asking for a video chat by the company. And it just so happened, two weeks later, I popped into All Mail and the HR person‚Äôs email was at the top, asking if I had received the email and that they really wanted to chat with me.WTF? Is this real life?I responded, perhaps a bit too enthusiastically. We set up a time within the next couple of days.That day after I received that email, I literally could have run around my neighborhood 2. I could hardly sleep.The Day of The InterviewI went to bed at 7 PM after taking three melatonin for sleep 3. The next day, I showered, got dressed up and sat in front of the webcam 10 minutes early. I was pumped and nervous.They came on and introduced themselves. Asked me to tell them something about me. I mentioned I was originally an English major. They were both English majors in college.. We talked about my projects. The tech lead said he saw that I was coding a markdown grammar checker and hoped it would be named, Check Yo Self and it was.I mean, you can‚Äôt start an interview better than this.The tech lead didn‚Äôt get too technical with me, just asking about my projects, mentioning that Check Yo Self is a big undertaking. I was happy he felt that way. I need that.He mentioned testing, and a few other things. I don‚Äôt have any testing experience. There were things I didn‚Äôt know. And I let them know it.After the InterviewThey let me know they would contact me in a couple days to let me know if I moved on to round 2. There were four or five rounds. The second round was meeting with more technical people. The third was meeting the bosses. Fourth round was meeting in their headquarters with that team. And the fifth was meeting with the team in Pittsburgh.I felt like I had a great shot at the second round, the interview went so damn well. They have in their emails that they are committed to diversity and inclusion and if you didn‚Äôt have access to video equipment they would accommodate you. This is so rare. So so rare. I felt extremely lucky to have an interview with such a great company with these great people.I didn‚Äôt do anything at all that night except bask in the fact that I had nailed that interview. It was catharsis for me. I have spent the past three years learning and that interview was validation that people have seen I am working hard and know what I am doing. It felt like a weight had been lifted and now I could have more confidence.I also wasn‚Äôt stupid. I knew I needed to apply elsewhere because nothing is guaranteed.The Follow-upThe next day I received this email:  Hi Tiffany,  Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with [redacted] and me yesterday to discuss the JavaScript position at [redacted].  While we enjoyed chatting with you and were impressed with your personality and passion for web development, we will not be moving forward with your application.

We‚Äôd encourage you to continue on the road you‚Äôre already on and to consider applying again in the future! You‚Äôre incredibly smart and capable, so we‚Äôre excited to see you continue building on your web development knowledge base.  Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you have questions of any kind!  Thanks and best wishes!I read that email five times in a row. It stung but that email was so‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. It is rare to get an email like that from a company that isn‚Äôt going to hire you, with feedback, etc. They really liked me, thought I was incredibly smart and wanted me to apply again when I gained more experience. I may not have gotten the job but I can‚Äôt be mad. I‚Äôd been validated, even in rejection.What‚Äôs NextI‚Äôve decided to take some time to learn testing and React, as well as user auth with Passport.js, as well as Locomotive, an MVC framework built on top of Express.

    "productivity-devs": {
      "title": "Productivity for Devs",
      "content"	 : "While perusing The Practical Dev for new posts, I came across a post that intrigued me: Instant +100% command line productivity boost. Productivity for devs is something I‚Äôve been meaning to write about. Now I have the impetus to do so.I thought installing oh-my-szh and using aliases made me a badass. Unfortunately for me, that wasn‚Äôt the case.This post is going to talk about productivity for developers, much like on the Syntax.fm show on the topic.Getting Sh*t DoneI find, first and foremost, that a great task manager is essential to remembering what you need to do. I use OmniFocus for my main task manager, on all my devices 1. OmniFocus may seem rigid in its attempt at GTD but it is pretty flexible: use what you want.Trello for Project ManagementI use Trello to manage my projects and it does a fantastic job at that. Needing a high level and visual overview of what I need to get done, I reach for the Trello Mac app every time.Dev ToolsFor my shell I use iTerm 2 which is in its 3rd iteration 2 and zsh shell.Wes Bos has a great theme for all the things, a fork of the Sublime Text Cobalt2 theme and it is what I am using on iTerm as well as Visual Studio Code 3 which is faster than Atom though it lacks multiple projects in one window.With the theme and the powerline fonts which show your git statuses and which directory you‚Äôre in, it makes for a great looking terminal.iTerm has the ability to have separate profiles for whatever you want. For instance, I have a Check Yo Self profile that I can switch to whenever I want to work on that particular app.Command Line ToolsZsh Syntax HighlightingKnowing if you have a typo in an alias or command is crucial to not screwing everything up. One of the ways to tell what you‚Äôre typing is by using zsh-syntax-highlighting. You can customize the color of the highlights by looking at the highlighter docs.Z - Jump Aroundz is a utility that allows you to jump to different directories by typing z and then the directory. You‚Äôll have to cd around in directories for a bit to ‚Äútrain‚Äù it but once you do, it‚Äôs pretty easy to skip around in directories. It is a ‚Äúfrecent‚Äù tool: frequent and recent directories.Exa: ls replacementAnother cool command line utility is exa, which replaces ls with some nifty features like syntax highlighting and a ton of other commands. Just type exa and it will list the contents of your directory. You can get directory permissions, print each item on one line with the -1 flag, and much more.Miscellaneous ToolsAlfredI use Alfred app for navigating pretty much everything. The workflows make it, where I can create gists out of files, search Stack Overflow, add Trello cards to different boards, and make OmniFocus tasks out of Chrome tabs, and much more.      Getting things done or...wasting time?I also use Wes Bos‚Äôs Cobalt2 Alfred theme for this.Go Fucking WorkGo Fucking Work is a Chrome extension. It‚Äôs similar to Stay Focused but a lot harsher‚Ä¶as the name suggests.I swear like a sailor when I am around people I know and so I appreciate this extension for what it is and its customizability. There are alternatives of course, if sweary things aren‚Äôt your jam.            Currently Omnigroup only makes Apple apps and don‚Äôt have a web interface for OmniFocus. A web interface may be coming soon. On Android, there is an app that interfaces with OmniFocus using the Omnigroup‚Äôs API called Focus GTD.¬†&amp;#8617;              Shouldn‚Äôt it be called iTerm 3?¬†&amp;#8617;              This is the new hotness. I tried it when it first came out and used it exclusively but went back to Atom because of the plugins. Everyone seems to be talking about it now so I gave it another shot.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

Open sourcing my goals has made me pay attention to what I am doing and when. This past week I didn‚Äôt get much done, and hesitated sharing it to my personal goals repo. But I did. And it looks pretty bad.Goals for the Year and Year in Review PostsUna posts her Goals for the Year and Year in Review on her blog and I decided I‚Äôd do the same thing on this one.I had my goals on my other blog. Since it is no longer a Apple productivity blog I‚Äôll do it here. It makes more sense here than there.What Do You ThinkI thought this was a great idea immediately. What do you think? Will you try it? Two weeks in and I am hooked.            Especially if you procrastinate and get off schedule on weekends like I do.¬†&amp;#8617;¬†&amp;#8617;2      ",

      "title": "Functional Programming in JavaScript? Yes Please.
",
      "content"	 : "One of the hot topics right now in the web development world is functional programming in the language of the web, JavaScript.Functional programming encompasses a whole host of mathematical properties and phenomena that is beyond this post, but what I am going to address here is how to write a a few functions with nominal functional programming.This is going to be a series. I am currently researching these topics as I go along and what I find excites me. I will be digging into these topics, each array method bit by bit. You can find some more of this on Steve Smith‚Äôs blog Funky Javascript.Important Concept: Higher Order FunctionsOne of the best and worst parts about JavaScript is that you can pass functions into other functions. This can lead to beautifully expressive code and sometimes bugs.Why can we do this? Because, like in most functional programming languages 1, functions are values just like any other value in JavaScript.Take this code:// Named function or// function declarationfunction double(x) {  return x *¬†2;}// Anonymous function or// Function expressionlet double = function(x) {  return x *¬†2;}let cat = double;// Function callcat(60);// returns 120, obviouslyHere we have named function called double. It takes an argument, x and when you call it, it returns whatever the value of x is that you specify in the function call and returns it.What‚Äôs different about JavaScript is that you can pass it into a variable and call the function from that variable. This is because, well, functions are values.Higher order functions are good for composition to take smaller functions and make them into bigger functions. More on this in a minute.Enter .filter()The .filter() function is an array function that takes a callback that it uses to create a new filtered version of an array.Take this array of objects:const animals = [  { name: ‚ÄòCatticus Finch‚Äô, species: ‚Äòcat‚Äô },  { name: ‚ÄòPeaches‚Äô species: ‚Äòfish‚Äô },  { name: ‚ÄòBobby‚Äô, species: ‚Äòdog‚Äô },  { name: ‚ÄòLucifer‚Äô, species: ‚Äòcat‚Äô },  { name: ‚ÄòBeatrix‚Äô, species: ‚Äòrabbit‚Äô },  { name: ‚ÄòCerulean‚Äô species: ‚Äòfish‚Äô }];Say I wanted to filter out all this cats in this array. We could use the trusty for loop:const cats = []for (let i = 0; i &amp;amp;lt; animals.length; i++) {  if (animals[i].species === ‚Äòcat‚Äô) {    cats.push(animals[i]);  }}We are essentially just looping through the array and for every cat the for loop finds, it pushes it into the empty cat array.Now, we can filter.Filter accepts a callback and loops through each item in the array and passes it back to the callback function. .filter() expects a boolean and then returns the filtered array.In ES5:const cats = animals.filter(function(animal) {  return animal.species === ‚Äòcat‚Äô;});In ES6const cats = animals.filter(animal =&amp;gt; animal.species === ‚Äòcat‚Äô);Here, if the value of the species property in the animals array is a cat it will return the names of those cats in a filtered array.We could also write an anonymous function and add a filter function inside of it, much like this:const isCat = function(animal){  return animal.species === ‚Äòcats‚Äô;});const cats = animals.filter(isCat);How Cool is This?Writing small functions allows composition which we can reuse. In the for loop, we are pushing cats into the array but filter handles this natively.Filter and the callback are composed as they are meshed into each other. Not only is it syntactically pleasing, but it is less lines of code which is always a good thing.Next UpNext I want to tackle the .map() function and get back to my Chrome DevTools series.            Though JavaScript isn‚Äôt a purely functional programming language.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

The definition of a Map object can be found on the MDN.Adam Recvlohe, a fellow freeCodeCamp Camper on LinkedIn recommended I use a Map for changing the background of my freeCodeCamp Weather App dynamically. He showed me some code and I eventually settled on this:const iconMap = {  &#39;clear-day&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/sunny.jpg)&#39;,  &#39;partly-cloudy-night&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/fineas-anton-136459+copy.jpg)&#39;,  &#39;clear-night&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/sam-mcjunkin-38078.jpg)&#39;,  &#39;partly-cloudy-day&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/jeff-nafura-294909.jpg)&#39;, &#39;cloudy&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/jonatan-pie-260835.jpg)&#39;, &#39;rain&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/3opt_rain.jpeg)&#39;, &#39;sleet&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/jonatan-pie-190398.jpg)&#39;, &#39;snow&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/snow.jpg)&#39;, &#39;wind&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/jon-flobrant-2845.jpg)&#39;, &#39;fog&#39;: &#39;url(https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/weatherappfcc/elaine-li-416.jpg)&#39;};(function() {  $(&#39;body&#39;).css(&#39;background-image&#39;, iconMap[currentIcon]);})();Here, we take a Map object and use an anonymous function calls the .css jQuery method on the body which will change the background image by injecting that css into the body. Also as an argument to the css method is an iteration over the iconMap Map object that maps each image to the currently displayed Skycon.Next: Cleaning Up The if/else Mess of an Icon DisplayUp above you probably observed my conditional hell. It was the same for the icons where I called the jQuery show()/hide() methods in if/else statements for every. Icon. Pure insanity.I went to the Code Newbie Slack and asked Joseph Rex for help as he has been guiding me through a few of the Express and other JavaScript problems I have been having. After some bugs and error handling we came up with a nifty ES6 solution that is much cleaner, using Template Literals to clean up the constant calls to each icon.// Write a function that takes two parameterslet iconDisplay = (iconName, current) =&amp;gt; {   //Assign a template literal to a constant that will//represent each icon   const jqObj = $(`#${iconName}`);   // Use the ternary operator to determine with the //iconName is the current icon being shown for the condition//and based on that, show or hide the appropriate icon   iconName === current ? jqObj.show() : jqObj.hide();}; // call the function and compare it to the Skycon for each // Weather condition. iconDisplay(&quot;clear-day&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;clear-night&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;partly-cloudy-day&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;partly-cloudy-night&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;cloudy&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;fog&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;rain&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;sleet&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;snow&quot;, currentIcon); iconDisplay(&quot;wind&quot;, currentIcon);Pretty cool.Pretty soon I‚Äôll be diving deep into how much I am learning about Express with The Web Developer Bootcamp.

Elements in an array are separated by a comma. An array can have any type of data, in any order, inside of the brackets.For instance:var myArray = [&quot;John&quot;, 39, &quot;Tiffany&quot;, 37, false];is a typical array. Usually we can get the index, or position, of a piece of data in an array by bracket or dot notation.Arrays in JavaScript can have a mixture of data types; in my example above I mix strings, numbers, and a boolean data type in one array.Initializing an ArrayYou can initialize an array as follows:var myArray = [10];You can also initalize an empty array such as:var emptyArray = [];This is useful for having a place to hold values that will be initialized later in your code.Accessing Array ElementsYou can access array elements by their index in the console. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, much like Java and other languages. An example of the syntax:var indexOfArray = [&quot;Jerri&quot;, 69, &quot;Tiffany&quot; 37, false];console.log(indexOfArray[4]); // This would return the boolean value &#39;false&#39;console.log(indexOfArray.[2]); // This is accessing an array with dot notation.// This would return &#39;Tiffany&#39;console.log(indexOfArray.1); // This isn&#39;t proper syntax as properties that begin with// a number can&#39;t be accessed using dot notationconsole.log(indexOfArray.0); // This is okay as it is a stringThe .length PropertyYou can see how many items are in an array with the .length property. The syntax is similar to accessing an index with dot notation:var howMany = [&quot;Jerri&quot;, 69, &quot;Tiffany&quot; 37, false];console.log(howMany.length); // this will return 5 as there are 5 items in the array.// Not to be confused with *indeces*This will be a series on working with arrays. Not sure how long it will be but there is so much rich information about arrays in JavaScript that I don‚Äôt think I could fit it all into one post. It may not be a series after all; I may just revisit the topic every now and again.ArraysAn array is an object in JavaScript. It is a global object set out in a list between two brackets []. Elements in an array are separated by a comma. An array can have any type of data, in any order, inside of the brackets.For instance:var myArray = [&quot;John&quot;, 39, &quot;Tiffany&quot;, 37, false];is a typical array.

User 1: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt understand how to filter by type‚Äù. User 2: n/a User 3: ‚ÄúThere is a lack of vertical rhythm, making the site too colourless isn‚Äôt pleasant, there are no boundaries on main elements, there is no visual guidance, and the carousel isn‚Äôt really a good idea in terms of displaying content.

Take a look at the modular scale to improve font sizes. Take a look at the material colour collections. And work with defined (xs, sm, md, lg) sizes, so that responsiveness isn‚Äôt an issue.‚Äù User 4: ‚ÄúContent hierarchy is paramount in a site like this one.‚Äù User 5: ‚Äúnono, overall i liked the site‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a production site but works as a prototype.‚Äù User 6: ‚Äúcontact and pricing sections need more UI/UX work‚ÄùObservationsDevicesMost people used a PC or Mac when accessing The Lens Cap, some of the users using more than one device. I could have improved the testing by asking the load times for each device and what kind of connection on each. As I started the test, I was expecting to have less technical users but it turned out most of my users were tech savvy; all but one was a developer/designer.Site SpeedThe site loaded fairly quickly‚Äî there were no load times over 2s. Even so, I‚Äôd like to make sure each load time on each device is under 2s. Studies suggest that users will bounce off a site if it loads in &amp;gt;2s. I‚Äôd like to get the load speed down and can do so with minification of JavaScript, adding scripts to the bottom of the page, and eliminating unnecessary libraries.I could also optimize the images further or serve them over a CDN.ResolutionThe resolution of the site was consistent across devices, without any elements becoming blurry.AttractivenessFive out of the 6 users found the site appealing with 3 finding it very visually appealing. The lone user who said it was less than appealing found the layout, use of the carousel, and lack of vibrant colors a turn off. I fretted over the use of color a lot during this project. In the end, I went with my preference instead of what my users may want. The use of material color design, etc was something I thought about and while this user was in the minority, I know the conventional wisdom is to have more than just the neutral brown, gray, black, etc.Element SpeedThe carousel loaded the slowest out of all the elements. Half of users had the carousel load quickly, between 0-1s, 2 had the carousel load between 1-2s, and one user answered that the carousel loaded in a very slow 2-3s.To reduce speed, I‚Äôd probably have to add less features to the script‚Äôs object. Though some of the elements of the carousel weren‚Äôt rendering, I left them in the main object. Slick.js carousel optimization was tricky for me on such great connections.SearchMost people could not find the search because it was so laid into the design. The amount of users who could find things easily and those who couldn‚Äôt were scattered evenly along the continuum of ‚Äú1‚Äù being very easy and ‚Äú5‚Äùbeing very hard.Making the search part of the menu could have helped this instead of using the search as part of the pricing page.Fonts/CopyThe font choice, Lato, was the correct one, with all users being able to read the text. It wasn‚Äôt too small or to light. I feel the color could be darker in some areas for older eyes.ConclusionFor my first site built with a template and then overhauled, it was a moderate success. I am not a designer, and I don‚Äôt want to be a designer, and so my knowledge of color and harmony are limited.

      "title": "The Execution Stack and Scope",
      "content"	 : "What is the Execution Stack? Before I answer that question, we‚Äôll first have to take a look at the Global Execution ContextThe Global Execution Context, in general terms, is the environment in which the function gets invoked, or the variable‚Äôs scope. The Global Execution Context, creates global object, a window object, and a this variable in its creation phase as well as storing any variables you‚Äôve made stored in memory.The first function gets created on the global execution context called an, as you probably guessed, execution context and has its own space for variables and functions. The global execution context reads line by line until it comes to the next function. Every function creates a new execution context. Once there are no more functions to execute the top function on the execution context gets popped off. Whatever is at the top is currently running.The Global Execution Context, then, is the outer portion of the Execution Stack or Call Stack. The functions that are invoked in the Execution Stack are lexically sitting on top of one another and being called from top to bottom. JavaScript is a synchronous language, which means the code you write gets executed line by line, from top to bottom.Talking About the Scope ChainSo how do the execution stack and the scope chain come together? It depends on where the function sits lexically. Take a look at this code:function myFunction() {console.log(myVar);}function yourFunction() {var myVar = 68;yourFunction();}var myVar = 37;myFunction();The execution stack has to search for the variables you defined and where you defined them, making references to the outer lexical environment. This is called the scope chain.When this code is executed, since the scope chain can‚Äôt find myVar in function yourFunction() because it isn‚Äôt lexically in the local scope (remember your scopes) and the outer reference is in the global execution context, the console.log will display 37.If we were to change where function yourFunction() sits lexically in the execution stack, for instance:function myFunction() {function yourFunction() {console.log(myVar);}var myVar = 68;yourFunction();}var myVar = 37;myFunction();Everything is created along the same lines. The global execution context is created, myFunction() sits on top of the global execution context, yourFunction() sits on top of it. But when the scope chain looks for its outer reference lexical environment this time, yourFunction()‚Äôs outer reference lexical environment is myFunction() because yourFunction() sits lexically inside of it.What is the Execution Stack?

      "content"	 : "&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-type-coercion&quot;&amp;gt;What is Type Coercion&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;Type coercion is essentially implicitly or explicitly changing the data type in JavaScript.You can do this in a couple of ways but first, let‚Äôs take a look at some ways the JavaScript engine tries to coerce types.&amp;lt;h2 id=&quot;operator-precedence&quot;&amp;gt;Operator Precedence&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;Knowing operator precedence is a must when working with any programming language. You can check out the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence&amp;quot;&amp;gt;MDN&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for information about operator precedence.The operators or operator functions we are going to use in these examples are &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt; &amp;gt; + - * / == and ===&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;.These operators are read from left-to-right in the JavaScript engine. The assignment operator &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is read from right-to-left.Take a look at this code:&amp;lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;kd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;var&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;coerce&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;console&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;log&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;coerce&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;);&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;Because we are using comparison operators, the console will return a Boolean value. In this case, when the code is run in the console, it returns &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, like normal humans would assume.&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/images/Screenshot2016-02-26_02-42-17_AM.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;True&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;center-image&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;But look at this code:&amp;lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;kd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;var&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;coerce&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;console&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;log&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;coerce&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;);&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;This is just reversing the order of the numbers and the comparison operators. Normally we‚Äôd assume this to be true. But check out the console:&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/images/Screenshot2016-02-26_02-45-12_AM.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;False&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;center-image&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;It returns &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. Why? It‚Äôs coercion.When the JavaScript engine computates this code, remember, it will read it from left-to-right.In JavaScript, &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; have values, where &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; coerces to 1 and &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; coerces to 0.&amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;4 &amp;gt; 3&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; returns &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. Now, JavaScript reads the next operation as &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1 &amp;gt; 2&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; which is obviously going to return &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. We then have &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;false &amp;gt; 1&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;0 &amp;gt; 1&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; which is false.&amp;lt;h3 id=&quot;coercion-with-equality-operators&quot;&amp;gt;Coercion with Equality Operators&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;Equality operators are the equality &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;==&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; and strict equality &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;===&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; operators. When we use the plain equality operator, we can coerce a string into a number, a number into a Boolean, etc. Take a look at this code:&amp;lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;==&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;Here we are saying the data type &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;number&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is equal to the data type &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;string&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; which isn‚Äôt correct. But because we are using the ‚Äúnon-strict‚Äù equality operator, it coerces to &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; as we can see in the console:&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/images/Screenshot2016-02-26_07-31-48_PM.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Equality&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;center-image&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;You can assume that strict equality, then, would yeild false if we were to enter this into the console:&amp;lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;===&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;/images/Screenshot2016-02-26_07-34-53_PM.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Strict_equality&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;center-image&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;h3 id=&quot;thoughts&quot;&amp;gt;Thoughts&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;There are reasons to use coercion but typically it‚Äôs bad practice. Apparently some ES6 syntax takes some of the pain of coercion away, but as you can see, you could very well end up with hard to identify bugs in your code so it‚Äôs best to use strict equality when you are comparing something and consider operator precedence when using comparison operators.",

    "javascript-vs-java-pass-by-value-and-reference": {
      "title": "JavaScript vs Java Pass by Value and Reference",
      "content"	 : "Different Languages, Different ParadigmsWhen you are working with different languages at the same time, it is important to note that while most languages are based on C, each langauge has its own set of rules and paradigms associated with it that makes similar conventions different.Java and JavaScript, while having Java in common, are completely different languages1. As such, the way they deal with primitive values2, functions and methods, arguments and parameters, differ as well.Dealing With Objects and Methods in JavaJava is an Object Oriented Programming language which basically means creating objects as part of a class, instantiating the object and adding methods to the object to actually do things with the newly created objects. You can then make your code more modular by adding and calling functions that manipulate the code in some way.3You can create an object such as:  public class Dog {      int dogAge;      public Dog(string name) {      System.out.println(&amp;amp;quot;My dog&amp;amp;#039;s name is &amp;amp;quot; + name &amp;amp;quot; .&amp;amp;quot;);   }   public void setAge (int age) {       dogAge = age;    }   public int getAge() {       System.out.println(&amp;amp;quot;My dog is &amp;amp;quot; + dogAge + &amp;amp;quot; years old&amp;amp;quot;);       return dogAge;     }     public static void main (String []args) {     /* Create an object using the new keyword */         Dog myDog = new Dog(&amp;amp;quot;Max&amp;amp;quot;);         myDog.setAge(11); // setAge is a class method on the object Dog         myDog.getAge();         System.out.println(myDog.dogAge);       }    }Here we have a class and a constructor, a new object Dog with a few getter and setter methods on the Dog object.This is standard Java OOP stuff. JavaScript isn‚Äôt an OOP language, it is a prototypal language which creates object prototypes in order to extend objects through prototypal inheritance instead of classical inheritance, like Java.4Dealing with Objects and Methods in JavaScriptObjects in JavaScript are not created the same way as in Java. At least not technically, and this:    function Car() {     const car1 = new Car();    }should be avoided.5We can create an object literal such as:    const myObject {        foo: &amp;amp;#039;bar&amp;amp;#039;,        car: &amp;amp;#039;Mazda&amp;amp;#039;,        age: 38    }and add methods onto the object such as:    myObject.car = &amp;amp;#039;Honda&amp;amp;#039;;and pass them to other methods like console.log:    console.log(myObject.car);Pass by Value in JavaScriptThe only thing you can pass by value in JavaScript are primitive data types.Passing by value means that you have two variables in memory that are assigned to one another. For instance:     var a;    var b = 8;    var a = b;    console.log(b); // will return 8What‚Äôs happening when we pass these primitives by value, we are making a copy of the value of the variable b stored in memory, say at address 0x001 and assigning it to a stored at 0x002. Both a and `b mirror each other as they are just copies of one another. This is what is meant when we say we are passing by value in JavaScript.Pass by Value in JavaTake this bit of code:    int y = 10;    changeMeToSix (y);    System.out.println(y);    // [...some code]    void changeMeToSix (int x) {        x = 6;    }This doesn‚Äôt print 6. It prints 10. Why? Because only the value 10 was passed into the method, not the variable itself.Another example:    Dog myDog;This is not actually a dog but a pointer to the Dog instance in memory. So if we have:    public void foo (Dog yourDog) {        yourDog.setName(&amp;amp;quot;Sparky&amp;amp;quot;);        yourDog = new Dog(&amp;amp;quot;Max&amp;amp;quot;);        yourDog.setName(&amp;amp;quot;Jeffie&amp;amp;quot;);    }Let‚Äôs say the parameter yourDog is at memory address 0x001.The first line is followed to the Dog it points to, which is the Dog object at 0x001. That dog is asked to change names to Sparky, at the same address of 0x001.In the second line, a new Dog is created at a different address, say, 0x006. We assign the yourDog param to the memory address 0x006.In the last line, yourDog is followed to the new Dog it points to in 0x006. That Dog changes his name to Jeffie. Then it returns.myDog didn‚Äôt change. myDog is a pointer in memory that points to the original address, 0x001, not an actual Dog.You can pass references to parameters by value and not the actual references themselves.Pass by Reference JavaScriptPassing by reference in JavaScript can only happen to objects. This includes functions as functions are first-class objects in JavaScript.[^6]Passing by reference involves having two references point to the same object in memory. This means you can mutate and object or function by assigning it to another object or passing it as a parameter to a function. Take this code:    // by reference (all objects (including functions))   const greet = {      greeting: &amp;amp;#039;hi&amp;amp;#039;    };   const greet1;  greet1 = greet;  greet.greeting = &amp;amp;#039;hello&amp;amp;#039;; // mutates to hello  console.log(greet);  console.log(greet1);  // by reference (even as parameters)  function changeGreeting(obj) {    obj.greeting = &amp;amp;quot;What&amp;amp;#039;s up?&amp;amp;quot;; // mutates to What&amp;amp;#039;s Up  } changeGreeting(greet1);console.log(greet);console.log(greet1);// equals operator sets up new memory addressgreet = {    greeting: &amp;amp;#039;Yo&amp;amp;#039;};console.log(greet); // Mutates to Yoconsole.log(greet1);‚Ä¶and so on.Understanding the difference between pass by value and pass by reference is key to understanding how JavaScript objects and primitives work.Pass by Reference in Java?You cannot pass by reference in Java. As Jon Skeet puts it:  Pass by reference mixes inputs and outputs of code. This is the fundamental problem with the technique. In Java, a programmer can assume that variables will not change their value when passed as parameters to a method. In languages with pass by reference semantics, this basic assumption cannot be made.  Pass by reference confuses the interface to a method. Methods written using pass-by-reference semantics can have extremely complex interfaces that are difficult for client programmers to learn and understand.Excluding pass by reference was a design choice. It fills a need in some languages, like JavaScript but can present problems in others.That Was LongSorry about the length! If you have anything to add, leave a comment down below. Let me know if I am wrong or off-base. I don‚Äôt mind.UPDATE: I suppose you can‚Äôt redeclare a variable with let in the example of pass by value in JS. So I went to the console, did some console-fu and decided to use var though it is dated. Still learning ES6.UPDATE 2: So I learned you cannot pass by reference in JavaScript though that is exactly what I was taught, albeit incorrectly. You can pass a reference to another object, but you cannot pass by reference in JavaScript.            Both languages are based on C, however.¬†&amp;#8617;              Both Java and JavaScript have primitive types. Java has strongly typed primitive values. See this post for Java data types.¬†&amp;#8617;              Technically, in Java, you can use method and function interchangeably but I really don‚Äôt like doing that. See this answer.¬†&amp;#8617;              Eric Elliott has talked about this a lot. Check it out for the differences inheritance between the two languages.¬†&amp;#8617;              This is creating an object using a JavaScript constructor and the new keyword, mimicking OOP inheritance in JavaScript. Douglas Crockford recommends that you avoid it.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

Not only is it free but it encourages responsible Googling, with their Read-Search-Ask methodology, contributing to Open Source, and introducing beginners to data structures and algorithms. I use Free Code Camp concurrently with my Computer Science major at Pitt.Free Code Camp‚Äôs Medium Publication: great resource for articles on everything from JavaScript, to landing a job, negotiating, and Big Data. Great reads on there so check it out.JavaScript Scene: Eric Elliott is a opinionated but well know figure in the JavaScript community. He runs the Medium publication JavaScript Scene which is a rich resource of JS content and strategies.YDKJS: the YDKJS series or, You Don‚Äôt Know JavaScript series, is probably the best series of books on the topic of JavaScript available. Kyle Simpson is the author and he knows his stuff. Pick up all the books. You can buy them or read them on GitHub.List Your Go-TosWhat do you use to learn JavaScript? Am I missing anything.

Let‚Äôs take a look at some CSS transforms.CSS transforms move, rotate, skew, and scale elements on the page relative to their respective containers. The center position is the default position, which starts at 0. For instance, the default is transform-origin: 0;.This means that when you skew, rotate, scale and element, it will do so relative the the center of the image, button, etc in its container.You can also use the CSS shorthand property transform to chain together different transforms. It also defaults to the center position on any property you specify.One of my favorite CSS transforms is the scale() function. It will make the image, button, etc larger relative to its own container. For instance:.element {  width: 20px;  height: 20px;  // Use the transform scale function  // to scale the element outwards  // 35px from the center  transform: scale(35);}This will scale the image quite large on the page.What if we want it to only scale when we hover?Well, we could add transform to a transition like this:.img-fluid {  // Select the img-fluid class and transition  // The transform property for 500 milliseconds  transition: transform .5s;}.img-fluid:hover {  // Transform the img-fluid class with the scale function  // This will scale the image on hover 1.1px from center  transform: scale(1.1);}How cool is that?On to Part 3‚Ä¶I will be writing about CSS shorthand properties for transition and transform.Transition Timing Functions, Delays, and TransformsYou can do some really cool things with CSS that I wasn‚Äôt sure I would like.I‚Äôm a big time JavaScript lover 1 and so I like to do things programmatically if I can.

It is worth mentioning that &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;forEach()&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; has perf costs and for large records and datasets, a &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;for&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; loop would be a better choice.An example of a &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;forEach&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; on an array would look like this:&amp;lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;kd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;var&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;array&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;7&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;9&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;];&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;array&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;forEach&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&amp;gt;function&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;item&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;index&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;{&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;console&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;log&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;item&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;);&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;});&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;This does essentially the same thing as a &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;for&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; loop only it is cleaner and perhaps easier to use.&amp;lt;h4 id=&quot;map-method&quot;&amp;gt;map() Method&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;This method creates a new method from elements in an old method using a callback function with three arguments: &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;currentValue&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;index&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;array&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;.You can use &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;map()&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;to parse an array of objects or return a new array full of different number sets than the previous array. For instance:&amp;lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;kd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;var&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;even&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;mi&amp;quot;&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;];&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&amp;gt;var&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;odd&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;even&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;map&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&amp;gt;function&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;num&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;{&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&amp;gt;return&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&amp;gt;num&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&amp;gt;});&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;is something I could use to find and return a new array of odd numbers from an old array of even ones.&amp;lt;h4 id=&quot;concat-method&quot;&amp;gt;concat() Method&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;This method just concatenates two arrays into one. For instance:&amp;lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;kd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;var&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;greetArr&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;World!&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;],&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;nx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;jsArr&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Javascript&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;is&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;fun!&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;];&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;kd&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;var&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;nx&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;jsGreet&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;o&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;nx&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;greetArr&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;p&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;nx&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;concat&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;p&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;nx&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;jsArr&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;p&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;);&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;nx&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;console&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;p&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;nx&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;log&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;p&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;nx&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;jsGreet&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;amp;quot;p&amp;amp;quot;&amp;gt;);&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;This will concatenate the arrays out to look like this:&amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;World!&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Javascript&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fun!&amp;quot;]&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;While we don‚Äôt want the commas in between the words, this gives you a basic idea of what &amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;highlighter-rouge&amp;quot;&amp;gt;concat&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; does.&amp;lt;h4 id=&quot;thoughts&quot;&amp;gt;Thoughts&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;These are just some of my favorite array methods for JavaScript.

      "content"	 : "So I am still working on Check Yo Self, but, like I do, I jumped into another tutorial where you build stuff. I am so stuck on and afraid of the logic of Check Yo Self that I decided that I needed to shore up some knowledge of basic JavaScript 1 so I bought, and have started working on The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele.Colt is a Bootcamp instructor in San Francisco 2 and has taught students how to be professional full-stack web developers for mountains of money. His Udemy course is usually $1000 but I got it for $10 on one of their deal weeks.It is one of the highest rated courses on Udemy and especially recommended by web devs across the internet.Relearning BasicsI started from the beginning. I did skip some HTML and CSS stuff but as I said on my Facebook page:  I guess starting out coding in HTML and CSS‚Ä¶It felt really easy and so I skipped over A LOT. Free Code Camp taught Bootstrap so I felt there was no need to learn deeper.  Taking the Web Developer Bootcamp course has opened my eyes to so much about semantic markup, what attributes, block level elements, inline elements, selectors, and properties are and their differences. Can‚Äôt believe I aced my intro to web dev class without knowing that much about basic web dev.It is never a good idea to skip things, no matter how ‚Äúeasy‚Äù they seem. I am learning that.Granted, as you get better there are things you can skip but if the language is new or the concepts are new, it behooves anyone to learn it. Do not skip it.Course CurriculumThis is a full stack course where we will basically learn the MEN stack. He excludes Angular. Not sure why but we will end up building several front and back end projects ending in YelpCamp, a Yelp clone for camps using Mongo, Express, and Node.Exercises.Here is a form I built in HTML that I had an issue with 3.&amp;amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;html&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;head&amp;amp;gt;

So I bought a Swift course from Steven 4 and award winning iOS dev from the Hacking With Swift series, Paul Hudson.I won‚Äôt be starting that course until after I start the other course I bought Modern React with Redux and Webpack.Got all of these courses for $10 a piece. Not too bad.So I am still working on Check Yo Self, but, like I do, I jumped into another tutorial where you build stuff. I am so stuck on and afraid of the logic of Check Yo Self that I decided that I needed to shore up some knowledge of basic JavaScript 1 so I bought, and have started working on The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele.Colt is a Bootcamp instructor in San Francisco 2 and has taught students how to be professional full-stack web developers for mountains of money. His Udemy course is usually $1000 but I got it for $10 on one of their deal weeks.It is one of the highest rated courses on Udemy and especially recommended by web devs across the internet.Relearning BasicsI started from the beginning. I did skip some HTML and CSS stuff but as I said on my Facebook page:  I guess starting out coding in HTML and CSS‚Ä¶It felt really easy and so I skipped over A LOT. Free Code Camp taught Bootstrap so I felt there was no need to learn deeper.  Taking the Web Developer Bootcamp course has opened my eyes to so much about semantic markup, what attributes, block level elements, inline elements, selectors, and properties are and their differences. Can‚Äôt believe I aced my intro to web dev class without knowing that much about basic web dev.It is never a good idea to skip things, no matter how ‚Äúeasy‚Äù they seem. I am learning that.Granted, as you get better there are things you can skip but if the language is new or the concepts are new, it behooves anyone to learn it. Do not skip it.Course CurriculumThis is a full stack course where we will basically learn the MEN stack. He excludes Angular. Not sure why but we will end up building several front and back end projects ending in YelpCamp, a Yelp clone for camps using Mongo, Express, and Node.Exercises.Here is a form I built in HTML that I had an issue with 3.&amp;amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;html&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;head&amp;amp;gt;

Nice.No Need for NaturalI was going to use the natural natural language tokenizers to parse out the markdown but I don‚Äôt need it. One less dev dependency is a good thing.Also, No Need for Heroku or PostgresI researched localStorage web API. Each browser has a set limit of how much data can be stored in the browser. I found this little utility to check how many MBs of storage I had to work with. 5 MBs in Chrome 2.

Nice.No Need for NaturalI was going to use the natural natural language tokenizers to parse out the markdown but I don‚Äôt need it. One less dev dependency is a good thing.Also, No Need for Heroku or PostgresI researched localStorage web API. Each browser has a set limit of how much data can be stored in the browser.

After the bout of depression subsided, I dove into SQL.Create, Read, Update, Delete: CRUDI asked around in the Code Newbie Slack and asked my buddy Alex if I could use localStorage to store the markdown documents.Let me backtrack.When I was designing the app, I got the idea of having the markdown documents collect on the side of the app, sort of like the design template I was using.

      "title": "Exploring Algorithms",
      "content"	 : "What Is Meant by an Algorithm?Algorithms are simple: they are a set of instructions broken down into simple steps in order to complete a larger task.For example, if I want to make a recipe for stuffed peppers, I would usually follow steps such as:      Preheat oven to 350¬∞F.    Cut out stem ends of bell peppers.    Discard stems.    Scoop out seeds.    Bring 8 cups water to a boil in a large pot and blanch the peppers until tender-crisp, about 1 minute.    Drain.    Cool under cold running water.    Set aside‚Ä¶  And so on.This is a really simple example of an algorithm.Using Algorithms in JavaIn Computer Science, there are well established methods given to students to help them master algorithms. One of them is the speeding ticket scenario, where you are making a text-based system to calculate fines for speeding, speeding in a construction zone, DUI, and being under 21 with a DUI, etc.Here, we step through getting the data with a few conditionals:public static void main (String args[]){// Create a scanner to read from keyboardScanner kbd = new Scanner (System.in);              // declare and assign values to variables that we can use laterString firstName=&quot;N/A&quot;,lastName=&quot;N/A&quot;;int age=0, speedLimit=0, actualSpeed=0, mphOverLimit=0;int baseFine=0, underAgeFine=0, zoneFine=0, totalFine=0;   //################ Input ######################   // Here, the person calculating the fine would enter the data which is   // read in by the scanner object   System.out.println(&quot;Enter your first name and last name. &amp;gt; &quot;);   firstName = kbd.next();   lastName = kbd.next();   System.out.println(&quot;Enter your age. &amp;gt; &quot;);   age = kbd.nextInt();   System.out.println(&quot;Enter the speed limit. &amp;gt; &quot;);   speedLimit = kbd.nextInt();   System.out.println(&quot;Enter your actual speed. &amp;gt; &quot;);   actualSpeed = kbd.nextInt();   System.out.println(&quot;Did the violation occur in a construction zone? Enter yes or no. &amp;gt; &quot;);   String inConstructionZone = kbd.next();   //########### Speed Limit Fines #########   // Algorithm, step by step, giving the computer instructions on how to calculate   // the fine using conditionals if (actualSpeed &amp;gt; speedLimit) { mphOverLimit = actualSpeed - speedLimit; }   else { mphOverLimit = 0; }   if (mphOverLimit &amp;lt; 5) { baseFine = 0; } else if (mphOverLimit &amp;lt;= 20) { baseFine = mphOverLimit / 5 * 30; } else if (mphOverLimit &amp;gt; 20) { baseFine = mphOverLimit / 5 * 50; } //########### Zone Fines ############   if (mphOverLimit &amp;lt; 5) { zoneFine = 0; }   else if (inConstructionZone.equals(&quot;yes&quot;) || inConstructionZone.equals(&quot;y&quot;) || inConstructionZone.equals(&quot;Yes&quot;) || inConstructionZone.equals(&quot;YES&quot;)) { zoneFine = baseFine * baseFine; } else if (inConstructionZone.equals(&quot;no&quot;) || inConstructionZone.equals(&quot;n&quot;) || inConstructionZone.equals(&quot;No&quot;) || inConstructionZone.equals(&quot;NO&quot;)) { zoneFine = 0; } //############## Age Fines ############# if (age &amp;lt; 21 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; mphOverLimit &amp;gt; 20) { underAgeFine = 300; } else { underAgeFine = 0; }   //############# Total Charges ############## totalFine = baseFine + zoneFine + underAgeFine;   // Telling the JVM to print out each formatted scanner input on a new lineSystem.out.println();System.out.format( &quot;name: %s, %sn&quot;,lastName,firstName );System.out.format( &quot;age: %d yrs.n&quot;,age );System.out.format( &quot;actual speed: %d mph.n&quot;,actualSpeed );System.out.format( &quot;speed limit: %d mph.n&quot;,speedLimit );System.out.format( &quot;mph over limit: %d mph.n&quot;,mphOverLimit );System.out.format( &quot;base fine: $%dn&quot;,baseFine );System.out.format( &quot;zone fine: $%dn&quot;,zoneFine );System.out.format( &quot;under age fine: $%dn&quot;,underAgeFine );System.out.format( &quot;total fine: $%dn&quot;,totalFine );} // END MAIN} // END CLASSSome More Complex AlgorithmsThere are more complex, established algorithms that use data structures like arrays, dictionaries, and linked lists. Most algorithms are judged on their complexity and effieciency, where efficiency does not necessarily mean speed.For example, the Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the values in an array from smallest to largest by assessing the first index and comparing it with the next. If the first value is larger than the second, the bubble sort algorithm swaps the two values.Here is a version of the bubble sort algorithm in pseudocode:procedure bubbleSort( list : array of items )   loop = list.count;      for i = 0 to loop-1 do:      swapped = false      for j = 0 to loop-1 do:               // compare the adjacent elements            if list[j] &amp;gt; list[j+1] then            // swap them            swap( list[j], list[j+1] )             swapped = true         end if               end for            // if no number was swapped that means       // array is sorted now, break the loop                  if(not swapped) then         break      end if         end for   end procedure return listThis a simple algorithm yet if you‚Äôre new to algorithms and programming in general, it may seem a bit daunting.To see the implementation in java:",

      "title": "Working on the Free Code Camp Weather App
",
      "content"	 : "I am working on the Free Code Camp weather app quite consistently.Understanding the difference between $getJSON() and $ajax() to parse the JSON response from your chosen weather API is key. You can technically use $getJSON but the $ajax API call syntax is much easier to understand, though is more verbose. You can also customize how you get your response as well as other options.Take:[javascript]$(document).ready(function() {if (navigator.geolocation) {navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {var lat = position.coords.latitude;var lon = position.coords.longitude;var url = ‚Äúhttps://api.darksky.net/forecast//&quot; + lat + &quot;,&quot; + lon;$.ajax({type: &#39;GET&#39;,url: url,dataType: &quot;jsonp&quot;,success: function(data))};[/javascript]This jQuery code has an $ajax() function with an object inside it. It specifies what type of ajax API call it needs, which is GET‚Äì we are retrieving information from the API, in the form of a JSON response. We are passing in the API URL which we assigned to the url variable in the self-executing anonymous function expression navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position). Also in the ajax call is the dataType which expects the type of data the response will give back which is most commonly jsonp, and the success callback.This is fairly easy to grok if you are familiar with jQuery.$.getJSON() or $ajax()?$.getJSON(url, data, success) is how you would use it.

Some are asking if you want to get the results asynchronously, using an xhr response from the server, and several other types of parameters. This gives you more control, depending on the API.Link to the App?I am working on the Free Code Camp weather app quite consistently.Understanding the difference between $getJSON() and $ajax() to parse the JSON response from your chosen weather API is key. You can technically use $getJSON but the $ajax API call syntax is much easier to understand, though is more verbose. You can also customize how you get your response as well as other options.Take:[javascript]$(document).ready(function() {if (navigator.geolocation) {navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {var lat = position.coords.latitude;var lon = position.coords.longitude;var url = ‚Äúhttps://api.darksky.net/forecast//&quot; + lat + &quot;,&quot; + lon;$.ajax({type: &#39;GET&#39;,url: url,dataType: &quot;jsonp&quot;,success: function(data))};[/javascript]This jQuery code has an $ajax() function with an object inside it. It specifies what type of ajax API call it needs, which is GET‚Äì we are retrieving information from the API, in the form of a JSON response. We are passing in the API URL which we assigned to the url variable in the self-executing anonymous function expression navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position).

    "ux-testing-results-for-the-lens-cap-mock-e-commerce-site": {
      "title": "Ux Testing Results For The Lens Cap Mock E Commerce Site",
      "content"	 : "SummaryI asked six users of various technical ability to test The Lens Cap‚Äôs UX: its responsiveness, its legibility, its resolution, and whether they were able to find what they needed in search, etc. I asked them to tell me which devices they used and asked for suggestions on how to make the site better, what surprised them, good or bad, about the site, and also if anything frustrated them while using it.Here are the results:Extended QuestionsWhat were some areas that frustrated you when using the site?  User 1: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt understand how to filter by type‚Äù.  User 2:  n/a  User 3: ‚ÄúThere is a lack of vertical rhythm, making the site too colourless isn‚Äôt pleasant, there are no boundaries on main elements, there is no visual guidance, and the carousel isn‚Äôt really a good idea in terms of displaying content. Calls to action weren‚Äôt clearly defined.‚Äù  User 4: ‚ÄúThere is no content hierarchy; it‚Äôs important on e-commerce sites.‚Äù  User 5: ‚ÄúThe content looks like a bit unstructured.‚Äù  User 6: ‚ÄúThe search function kind of fades into the design and it took me a moment to figure out where it was.‚ÄùWhat were some surprises, good or bad when using the site  User 1: ‚ÄúI was surprised I couldn‚Äôt find the search feature.‚Äù  User 2: n/a  User 3: ‚ÄúResponsiveness was weird, that‚Äôs bad. Typography is clear, it surprisingly works well.‚Äù  User 4: ‚ÄúGood, it‚Äôs simple to use. Bad? The ordering at the menu.‚Äù  User 5: ‚Äúthe menu, is bad‚Ä¶ not sure‚Äù  User 6: ‚ÄúMost surprising was the resizing photos on hover.‚ÄùSuggestionsDo you have any specific suggestions to improve the site?  User 1: ‚ÄúMake the search easier to find and perhaps give instructions to the user on how to filter by type?‚Äù  User 2: ‚Äúcontact and pricing sections need more UI/UX work‚Äù  User 3: ‚ÄúUse semantic guides and visual guides. Take a look at the modular scale to improve font sizes. Take a look at the material colour collections. And work with defined (xs, sm, md, lg) sizes, so that responsiveness isn‚Äôt an issue.‚Äù  User 4: ‚ÄúContent hierarchy is paramount in a site like this one.‚Äù  User 5: ‚Äúnono, overall i liked the site‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a production site but works as a prototype.‚Äù  User 6: ‚Äúcontact and pricing sections need more UI/UX work‚ÄùObservationsDevicesMost people used a PC or Mac when accessing The Lens Cap, some of the users using more than one device. I could have improved the testing by asking the load times for each device and what kind of connection on each. As I started the test, I was expecting to have less technical users but it turned out most of my users were tech savvy; all but one was a developer/designer.Site SpeedThe site loaded fairly quickly‚Äî there were no load times over 2s. Even so, I‚Äôd like to make sure each load time on each device is under 2s. Studies suggest that users will bounce off a site if it loads in &amp;gt;2s. I‚Äôd like to get the load speed down and can do so with minification of JavaScript, adding scripts to the bottom of the page, and eliminating unnecessary libraries.I could also optimize the images further or serve them over a CDN.ResolutionThe resolution of the site was consistent across devices, without any elements becoming blurry.AttractivenessFive out of the 6 users found the site appealing with 3 finding it very visually appealing. The lone user who said it was less than appealing found the layout, use of the carousel, and lack of vibrant colors a turn off. I fretted over the use of color a lot during this project. In the end, I went with my preference instead of what my users may want. The use of material color design, etc was something I thought about and while this user was in the minority, I know the conventional wisdom is to have more than just the neutral brown, gray, black, etc.Element SpeedThe carousel loaded the slowest out of all the elements. Half of users had the carousel load quickly, between 0-1s, 2 had the carousel load between 1-2s, and one user answered that the carousel loaded in a very slow 2-3s.To reduce speed, I‚Äôd probably have to add less features to the script‚Äôs object. Though some of the elements of the carousel weren‚Äôt rendering, I left them in the main object. Slick.js carousel optimization was tricky for me on such great connections.SearchMost people could not find the search because it was so laid into the design. The amount of users who could find things easily and those who couldn‚Äôt were scattered evenly along the continuum of ‚Äú1‚Äù being very easy and ‚Äú5‚Äùbeing very hard.Making the search part of the menu could have helped this instead of using the search as part of the pricing page.Fonts/CopyThe font choice, Lato, was the correct one, with all users being able to read the text. It wasn‚Äôt too small or to light. I feel the color could be darker in some areas for older eyes.ConclusionFor my first site built with a template and then overhauled, it was a moderate success. I am not a designer, and I don‚Äôt want to be a designer, and so my knowledge of color and harmony are limited. I am willing to learn through places like Treehouse, Sitepoint, etc.I have gained enough knowledge from this test to know where I need to improve.",

    "let-and-const-for-block-scope": {
      "title": "Let and Const for Block Scope",
      "content"	 : "Up until ES6, you couldn‚Äôt achieve true block scoping in JavaScript. With the var keyword, the scope in a code block could be accessed in the global scope, as variable declarations are hoisted to the top of scope and the assignments are kept where they are.For instance, take this code:function foo(a) {var b = 2;// some codefunction bar() {// ...}// more codevar c = 3;}The function foo sits in the global scope. Inside the foo function, we have the function bar as well as some variable assignments with var b = 2  and var c - 3 sitting in foo. Each of these identifiers and functions have access to the scopes outside of them, clouding the global namespace. We call these function scopes and typically, they aren‚Äôt a good idea.Examples of HoistingOne of the reasons it isn‚Äôt great to use var when declaring variable assignments is because of hoisting which I mentioned above. An example:   function bar() {  if (!foo) {var foo = 10;  }   alert(foo);}bar(); // alerts 10 instead of reference error  Instead of getting a reference error here, when bar() is executed, the alert(foo) function has access to var foo = 10; in the conditional block. So when the JavaScript compiler goes looking for foo it finds it because foo is not scoped solely to the conditional block.letWith ES6 1, you can create a block scope, or a scope that is contained within its own code block, by using let instead of var. For instance:    if (a) {  b = a * 2;  let a = 5;}console.log(b); // Reference Error! a is not defined.Here, the console.log(b); method call is looking for a but console.log can‚Äôt access a as it is scoped to the if block. This is a very simplistic example of block scoping with let.constconst also creates block scoping. It allows for the value the indentifier holds to be quasi immutable. The data can be mutated as const is only really immutable because it binds the value of the indentifier and should only be used when you want the value you‚Äôre using to be non-reassignable.You can make a const value immutable by adding object.freeze() method to it.What Should You Use?I‚Äôll leave you with a quote by Kyle Simpson:  let improves scoping options in JS, not replaces. var is still a useful signal for variables that are used throughout the function. Having both, and using both, means scoping intent is clearer to understand and maintain and enforce. That‚Äôs a big win!            ES2015. Sorry.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

But how could you use them?You could use them to ease on hover an image overlay:.img-overlay {  // Set background color of the overlay  background-color: #000000  // Define what property we are transitioning  transition-property: opacity;} .img-overlay:hover {  // Set the opacity  opacity: .06;  // Use the transition-delay transition   // to delay when a transition starts  transition-delay: .4s;  // Add a transition-timing-function   // to ease the transition out on hover  transition-timing-function: ease-out;}CSS TransformsThese are really cool. I think that they are great in moderation. Some of the transforms can make the user experience fun if not overdone. Let‚Äôs take a look at some CSS transforms.CSS transforms move, rotate, skew, and scale elements on the page relative to their respective containers. The center position is the default position, which starts at 0. For instance, the default is transform-origin: 0;.This means that when you skew, rotate, scale and element, it will do so relative the the center of the image, button, etc in its container.You can also use the CSS shorthand property transform to chain together different transforms. It also defaults to the center position on any property you specify.One of my favorite CSS transforms is the scale() function. It will make the image, button, etc larger relative to its own container. For instance:.element {  width: 20px;  height: 20px;  // Use the transform scale function   // to scale the element outwards  // 35px from the center  transform: scale(35);}This will scale the image quite large on the page.What if we want it to only scale when we hover?Well, we could add transform to a transition like this:.img-fluid {  // Select the img-fluid class and transition  // The transform property for 500 milliseconds  transition: transform .5s;}.img-fluid:hover {  // Transform the img-fluid class with the scale function  // This will scale the image on hover 1.1px from center  transform: scale(1.1);}How cool is that?On to Part 3‚Ä¶I will be writing about CSS shorthand properties for transition and transform.

But I was talking to my pal Alex Gwartneyon Skype and I mentioned what I was working on and how I served up assets over Heroku with PHP. He told me you could do the same thing with an Express server and Node.So we set off to get it set up. It was not easy.Getting the Site Set UpAlex and I spent two whole hours troubleshooting this. I knew from previous experience that you needed to have a Procfile and some npm dependencies. Alex helped me get a package.json file up by using npm init which I may have used once or twice but totally forgot about.I installed Express into that directory, etc. I did not include a Procfile immediately, though I should have.We worked on it for a while. He had trouble getting the Express server up on his end to show me what it could do. He got his end set up, then we worked on getting my site up on Heroku.Two Hours Later‚Ä¶Everything came up roses. There were certain things in the Procfile that needed to be added.

But I was talking to my pal Alex Gwartneyon Skype and I mentioned what I was working on and how I served up assets over Heroku with PHP. He told me you could do the same thing with an Express server and Node.So we set off to get it set up. It was not easy.Getting the Site Set UpAlex and I spent two whole hours troubleshooting this. I knew from previous experience that you needed to have a Procfile and some npm dependencies. Alex helped me get a package.json file up by using npm init which I may have used once or twice but totally forgot about.I installed Express into that directory, etc. I did not include a Procfile immediately, though I should have.We worked on it for a while. He had trouble getting the Express server up on his end to show me what it could do. He got his end set up, then we worked on getting my site up on Heroku.Two Hours Later‚Ä¶Everything came up roses. There were certain things in the Procfile that needed to be added. Opening ports in the Express server for Heroku to look for was a pain, but all in all, it was successful.Just in case you‚Äôre wondering how, here are a few gists.

",
      "content"	 : "This is an expos√® on the difference between function and block level scope using let and const in JavaScript. The following explanation is how I‚Äôve come to understand them so far 1.Function or Lexical ScopeTake this code:[javascript]function foo(a) {var b = 2;// some codefunction bar() {// ‚Ä¶}// more codevar c = 3;}[/javascript]Here we have a function foo that sits in the global scope. Nested within this scope is the function bar() and nested inside foo. Also within foo, we have the variable declaration var b = 2; and var c = 3;. Each of these belong to scope‚Äî foo to the global scope, var b, var b, and var c all scope to foo. Each of these scopes have access to functions and identifiers of the scopes outside them. None of these functions or identifiers are accessible outside of the function scope foo.Disadvantages of Function ScopesHoisting by the interpreterThe first pass the interpreter does on var processes it and lifts it to the top of the scope. It then processes the function declarations as uninitialized variables. 2An example of hoisting:        [javascript]   function bar() {      if (!foo) {        var foo = 10;      }                alert(foo);            }   bar(); // alerts 10 instead of reference error   [/javascript]Having to use an IIFE 3For beginners like me, this is confusing syntax. I see all IIFE as closures and I am sure that‚Äôs not the case. For instance:   [javascript]     (function(){ // all your code here var foo = function() {}; window.onload = foo; // ...      })();      // foo is unreachable here (it‚Äôs undefined)     [/javascript]In this example, the parentheses before function turn this block of code into a function expression. The final (); calls the function immediately after it is created. This creates a block scope for foo because it is nested within the function expression and invoked immediately. The syntax is hard to understand and thus remember.Creating Block Scopes with let and constYou can easily create block scopes with let. It is a new keyword in ES6 that makes it stylistically easier to create a block scope in some block of code (between {...}). The variable cannot be accessed in the global scope. Take this code for example:[javascript]if (a) {b = a * 2;let a = 5;}console.log(b); // Reference Error! a is not defined.[/javascript]The error here is because cosole.log() can‚Äôt access the a variable as let scopes it to the if block.let also signals to another developer that the identifier you‚Äôre using will be mutated at some point along the way, at least according to Eric Elliott. This is why he suggests using const for immutable identifiers.constThis creates block scope but allows for the data the identifier holds to be quasi immutable. The data can be mutated. const only is immutable in the sense that it binds the data to the identifier, and thus should be used when only when you want to treat a value as non-reassignable. In this instance, const is not like CONST in Java and other languages.You can actually make a const value immutable by adding object.freeze() to it.So let or const?If you took a minute to read the article I linked to by Eric Elliott, you‚Äôll see his strong opinion in favor of const.

Having both, and using both, means scoping intent is clearer to understand and maintain and enforce. That‚Äôs a big win!ThoughtsI am still not sure which is the right one to use and when. I am sticking with let for now, whenever I need block scopes. It is important to note you don‚Äôt have to use block scopes all the time.

    "es6-and-lambdas": {
      "title": "ES6 and Lambdas",
      "content"	 : "I am taking the JavaScript ES6 course on Treehouse. I should have waited a bit, as I am still learning ES5. Eric Elliott made the case that newbies should be learning ES6 right now as it is the current standard. So I am diving in.One of the things that has me excited are lambda functions. JavaScript calls them Arrow functions, but I like the traditional name better. So for this article, I will call them lambda functions.Here is an example of a lambda function being used in ES6:[javascript]‚Äòuse strict‚Äôvar Person = function (data) {  for (var key in data) {    this[key] = data[key];  }  this.getKeys = () =&amp;gt; {    return Object.keys(this);  }}var Alena = new Person({ name: ‚ÄòAlena‚Äô, role: ‚ÄòTeacher‚Äô });console.log(‚ÄòAlena&#39;s Keys:‚Äô, Alena.getKeys()); // ‚Äòthis‚Äô refers to ‚ÄòAlena‚Äôvar getKeys = Alena.getKeys;console.log(getKeys()); // ‚Äòthis‚Äô refers to the node process[/javascript]Here in the is a Person constructor object with a function that takes the parameter data. On this constructor is a method called getKeys that returns the object‚Äôs keys using a lambda function.Below that, a new Person object is instantiated and we log the keys for the Alena object to the console.The lambda function binds the function to the object, no matter where it is called.If we were to take a look at the code before the writing the lambda function, it would look like this:[javascript]‚Äòuse strict‚Äôvar Person = function (data) {  for (var key in data) {    this[key] = data[key];  }  this.getKeys = function () {    return Object.keys(this);  }}var Alena = new Person({ name: ‚ÄòAlena‚Äô, role: ‚ÄòTeacher‚Äô });console.log(‚ÄòAlena&#39;s Keys:‚Äô, Alena.getKeys()); // ‚Äòthis‚Äô refers to ‚ÄòAlena‚Äôvar getKeys = Alena.getKeys;console.log(getKeys()); // ‚Äòthis‚Äô refers to the node process[/javascript]This code will throw an exception because we are calling the getKeys method outside of the Person constructor code block. This means it is out of scope.More LambdasWhen code gets messy like this:[javascript]‚Äòuse strict‚Äô;var Teacher = function (data) {  this.name = data.name;  this.greet = function (studentCnt) {    let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {      if (studentCnt === 0) {        reject(‚ÄòZero students in class‚Äô);      } else {        resolve(Hello to ${studentCnt} of my favorite students!);      }    });    return promise;  }}var Classroom = function (data) {  this.subject = data.name;  this.teacher = data.teacher;  this.students = [];  this.addStudent = function (data) {    this.students.push(data);    this.greet();  }  this.greet = () =&amp;gt; {    this.teacher.greet(this.students.length).then(      (function (classroom) {        return function (greeting) {          console.log(${classroom.teacher.name} says: , greeting);        }      })(this),      function (err) {        console.log(err);      })  }}var myTeacher = new Teacher({ name: ‚ÄòJames‚Äô });var myClassroom = new Classroom({ name: ‚ÄòThe Future of JavaScript‚Äô, teacher: myTeacher });myClassroom.addStudent({ name: ‚ÄòDave‚Äô });[/javascript]it is a good idea to scrap the spaghetti code and write something with lambda or arrow functions, and use JavaScript Promises:[javascript]‚Äòuse strict‚Äô;var Teacher = function (data) {  this.name = data.name;  this.greet = function (studentCnt) {    let promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {      if (studentCnt === 0) {        reject(‚ÄòZero students in class‚Äô);      } else {        resolve(Hello to ${studentCnt} of my favorite students!);      }    });    return promise;  }}var Classroom = function (data) {  this.subject = data.name;  this.teacher = data.teacher;  this.students = [];  this.addStudent = function (data) {    this.students.push(data);    this.greet();  }  this.greet = () =&amp;gt; {     this.teacher.greet(this.students.length).then(       greeting =&amp;gt; console.log(${this.teacher.name} says: , greeting);         err =&amp;gt; console.log(err);  }}var myTeacher = new Teacher({ name: ‚ÄòJames‚Äô });var myClassroom = new Classroom({ name: ‚ÄòThe Future of JavaScript‚Äô, teacher: myTeacher });myClassroom.addStudent({ name: ‚ÄòDave‚Äô });[/javascript]You use Promises asynchronously with callback functions, handing those functions off to another scope. You must be careful that the promise can access its original scope, or it will throw an exception.Web Dev CS 0134I am taking the JavaScript ES6 course on Treehouse. I should have waited a bit, as I am still learning ES5. Eric Elliott made the case that newbies should be learning ES6 right now as it is the current standard.

You may want to work with MVC (something like React for Views) or backend frameworks (Node.js for the server), but those aren‚Äôt necessary to be a web developer, especially if design and front-end are something you want to focus on. Helper Skills (in purple) These are skills that aren‚Äôt related to your core skills but could be useful. For instance, algorithms aren‚Äôt a necessary skill but one that could come in handy when interviewing.Analyzing Your MapYou may find you are weak in some areas and need to spend more time focusing on them before you get to the outside set of skills. Or, you may find out that some of these skills don‚Äôt interest you at all and move onto something different altogether. The important thing here is to list them, color code them, and see what you‚Äôre solid in and what you need to get better at. [Tweet ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fall prey to FOMO and the framework rabbit hole.

    "objects-and-json": {
      "title": "Objects and JSON",
      "content"	 : "What are JavaScript Objects?When thinking about JavaScript objects, it is important to think about them in terms of real life objects. For instance, you have a cup, which is an object. The object has some properties: it is white, it has some text, it is holds 12 oz, it is used for coffee, etc.Now that we have a real life model of what a JavaScript object is like, we can begin to think about how to translate that into working code.How to Create an Object in JavaScriptBasically, the syntax will look like this:1objectName.propertyNameLet‚Äôs take a look at some simple examples of what are called object literals.Object Literal SyntaxAn object literal represents a value that you literally add to your script. It has a fixed value.Here is the syntax of an object literal:12345var obj = {prop1: &quot;string&quot;,prop2: 2,prop3: false};We assign the object literal to a variable obj. The following are what we call name/value pairs or key/value pairs where name or key is a property of the object and value is the value of that property.Object ConstructorsAnother way to write an object in JavaScript is to create an object constructor. You create an object constructor with the new keyword.1234var cats = new Cat();cats.color = &quot;Calico&quot;;cats.gender = &quot;male&quot;;cats.age = 2;We add properties to the Cat constructor through dot notation and adding a value, much like before:Accessing PropertiesYou can access properties in an object with dot or bracket notation. For instance:12obj.prop =&quot;value&quot;obj[prop] = &quot;value&quot;If we take a look at our Cat constructor, we can access its age by using either dot or bracket notation:12var atticus = cats[&quot;age&quot;];var felix = cats.age;This will return the value 2 for atticus and felix.JSONJSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is used to serialize objects, arrays, strings and other data structures and literals.JavaScript objects and JSON have a similar syntaxt but there are distinct differences.JSON syntax:123456{employees:[{ &quot;name&quot; : &quot;John&quot;}, {&quot;age&quot;: &quot;40&quot;}, {&quot;employeeID&quot;: &quot;347642&quot;}]}Looks similar but it isn‚Äôt. It is a simpler way to exhange data. Previously XML was used to store and exhange serialized data but this is far simpler and is the most widely adopted way to do this.ConclusionThere is so much more to get into with JavaScript Objects. As I get to know more I will post it. Soon, I‚Äôll go over prototypal inheritance, this, and more.",

I am finally coming out that, and am working quite hard on the things I had set up when I quit. I‚Äôve worked harder at learning, growing, and building since quitting.I need to get a medical withdrawal from the school‚Äî I left the semester under the care of a doctor but I didn‚Äôt properly withdraw‚Äî I could barely leave my apartment. It was pretty bad. So if I didn‚Äôt get the medical withdrawal, I would have failed the semester. I told my advisor I planned on coming back but not right now. I said it to be pleasant.

ZakasMy rating: 4 of 5 starsGreat, quick read that will help any new or intermediate JavaScript or web developer get more familiar with OOP JavaScript.The best parts of the book for me coincide with the things I am learning at Treehouse during their OOP JavaScript course in the full-stack JavaScript Track.As far as the OOP nature of JavaScript. A lot of the syntax and ideas borrow heavily from Java and it is evident when I am writing in JS. Fortunately, the book stresses the Prototypal Inheritance of JavaScript instead of thinking about it in a Classical Inheritance type of way. Eric Elliott has already crooned the virtues of Prototypal Inheritance, which is a feature of JavaScript people either love or hate.I learned a lot in this book, that really just gave me a slightly more in depth look into the stuff I was already learning. Having gone to Pitt for two semesters and taking CS classes, a lot the OOP stuff was familiar as Java is a Classical OOP language. But thinking about it in the JavaScript way was helpful.

Classical inheritance is seen as a big problem in JavaScript, which when you consider JavaScript doesn‚Äôt have real Classes, it makes sense. Brandon Eich, the creator of JavaScript admitted he wanted JavaScript to look like the little brother of Java, which leaves us with syntax that looks like Java when we use things like Constructors. For instance, in Java, you create a new Object like this:// Imports APIsimport java.util.Scanner;import java.io*;// Class definitionpublic class P3A1_White{// Main method    public static void main(String[] args)   {      Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);Where we are importing the Scanner Class and any I/O classes that Java has. We create a new Object here from the Scanner Class by using Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);. This is an example of Classical inheritance, creating Objects from either predefined Classes in the Java API or Classes you create.The syntax for creating Objects in JavaScript from Constructors, which is not the same as a Constructor function in Java, looks similar to creating an Object in Java.Take a look:function MyClass(name) {}var bob = new MyClass();  bob.set_name(&#39;Bob&#39;);  bob.announce(); // id is 1, name shows as &amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;var john = new MyChildClass(&#39;Doe&#39;);  john.set_name(&#39;John&#39;);  john.announce(); // id is 2, name shows as &amp;quot;John Doe&amp;quot;    alert(john instanceof MyClass); // trueNotice how we created the Objects: with the new keyword.

Short and sweet as opposed to the XMLHttpRequest method of vanilla JavaScript, which is here:var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {    if(xhr.readyState === 4) {       var employees = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);       var statusHTML = &#39;&amp;lt;ul class=&amp;quot;bulleted&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&#39;;       for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; employees.length; i += 1) {          if(employees[i].inoffice === true) {            statusHTML += &#39;&amp;lt;li class = &amp;quot;in&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&#39;;          } else {            statusHTML += &#39;&amp;lt;li class = &amp;quot;out&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&#39;;          }          statusHTML += employees[i].name;          statusHTML += &#39;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&#39;;      }      statusHTML += &#39;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&#39;;      document.getElementById(&#39;employeeList&#39;).innerHTML = statusHTML;   }};xhr.open(&#39;GET&#39;, &#39;data/employees.json&#39;);xhr.send();There‚Äôs a few more lines of code here but it just looks crazy.But, as I know and had gotten confirmed, the less dependencies the better. And for someone new, actually learning the XMLHttpRequest method of creating AJAX requests is something that I should do. The jQuery though.

That while computers will become anything but sentient, they will essentially make half the workforce obsolete. The author‚Äôs laissez faire attitude about this bothers me. He‚Äôs encouraging this.I understand the excitement surrounding machine learning ‚Äî we have Google Now, Siri, Amazon Echo, etc that understand what we want before we actually want it and as a developer, robotics fan, and data junkie, this excites me too.But for years we‚Äôve been excited by AI and machine learning, much like the resurgent VR. This is the new tech hotness. But where I take issue with this book is it looking so far into the future for a master algorithm that we can‚Äôt even quantify right now and that, once we do, the loss of physical jobs to our Amazon Echo overlords is welcome by not just Domingos but most machine learning gurus.Will we find a way to replace those lost jobs for the people it will affect? Who knows. The fact that it doesn‚Äôt cross Domingos mind to give this dilemma more than a cursory mention gives this book an air of arrogance that I find distasteful. 2 stars.View all my reviews",

We know it takes a period of time from when you‚Äôre working on a computer program and you switch to Twitter to recover that intense focus. The more you task switch, the worse it gets.The book made me uncomfortable because I realized how much time I was squandering; how much I wasn‚Äôt learning or practicing a certain skill. How many hours I‚Äôve spent mindlessly scrolling Facebook on my phone. I also know I really don‚Äôt know how to stop.Cal offers great suggestions and I have a few plugins and tools to make this easier. Being comfortable with being bored is difficult for many. Cal encourages his readers to force boredom on themselves and to stick with it.

This is why I have what I call my address-book-demo which I will need to call something more sexy, as launching pad to showcase what I‚Äôve learned outside of the hosted CodePen pens from Free Code Camp.Small Apps and WorkflowsOne of the most used apps on my Mac besides Keyboard Maestro, TextExpander, and various text editors, Ulysses, is a souped-up app and file launcher called Alfred.app. You can search for files, folders, launch apps, like Spotlight. But where it really shines is in it‚Äôs 3rd party workflows.What is a ‚ÄùWorkflow‚Äù?A workflow is a little python, ruby, or AppleScript script you build to extend Alfred functionality. You can use APIs from popular web services like Todoist, Trello, and even Hacker News to show and act on information from those web services.You can script apps like DEVONthink Pro Office, Slack, Atom Editor, the list goes on. Simply put, it makes your Mac an amazing productivity tool. You don‚Äôt have to open Todoist to add a task, hit ‚åò + Tab and you can go to work.What I Want to DoI want to build a few Alfred workflows for my own use cases. Not everyone needs a Ulysses workflow and there may be some already out there. Ulysses doesn‚Äôt have a robust API but they do have a nice url scheme you can script to add functionality to a Ulysses workflow.I want to build workflows for Pages.app, Ulysses.app, and Quiver.app, the programmers notebook.HappenApps has just opened up a Quiver scripting library I want to play with.

I need to keep grinding away at projects so I look good to prospective employers.I need to finish up some loose ends at Free Code Camp and I want to start Code Clinic Python with Lynda.com and Treehouse Python course refreshers. Need to manage my time better. This past week was awful for me.ThoughtsI have completed both front-end projects for Free Code Camp and I have taken a longer than usual break from programming for personal reasons but I miss it and am raring to get back to regularity.I am going to be going back to Free Code Camp to finish out the JavaScript track since they have added even more content‚Äî feels like I can‚Äôt keep up, which is frustrating but it‚Äôs good for the community.I also, however, know that all the tutorials in the world won‚Äôt help you actually build anything of use if you aren‚Äôt practicing. This is why I have what I call my address-book-demo which I will need to call something more sexy, as launching pad to showcase what I‚Äôve learned outside of the hosted CodePen pens from Free Code Camp.Small Apps and WorkflowsOne of the most used apps on my Mac besides Keyboard Maestro, TextExpander, and various text editors, Ulysses, is a souped-up app and file launcher called Alfred.app. You can search for files, folders, launch apps, like Spotlight. But where it really shines is in it‚Äôs 3rd party workflows.What is a ‚ÄùWorkflow‚Äù?A workflow is a little python, ruby, or AppleScript script you build to extend Alfred functionality. You can use APIs from popular web services like Todoist, Trello, and even Hacker News to show and act on information from those web services.You can script apps like DEVONthink Pro Office, Slack, Atom Editor, the list goes on. Simply put, it makes your Mac an amazing productivity tool. You don‚Äôt have to open Todoist to add a task, hit ‚åò + Tab and you can go to work.What I Want to DoI want to build a few Alfred workflows for my own use cases. Not everyone needs a Ulysses workflow and there may be some already out there. Ulysses doesn‚Äôt have a robust API but they do have a nice url scheme you can script to add functionality to a Ulysses workflow.I want to build workflows for Pages.app, Ulysses.app, and Quiver.app, the programmers notebook.HappenApps has just opened up a Quiver scripting library I want to play with. I have a prebuilt Quiver workflow I want to build upon.

      "content"	 : "The Charge: Activating the 10 Human Drives That Make You Feel Alive by Brendon BurchardMy rating: 1 of 5 starsI read the description of ‚ÄúThe Charge‚Äù and had my doubts‚Äì it was a $5.99-er from Audible which should have told me all I needed to know. I had $6 to burn so I bought it.I shouldn‚Äôt have.See, the problem with these kinds of books, as well as the lives of Content Marketers I follow, is that they automatically assume people wake up every morning unmotivated to change their own lives and financial circumstances; that getting super rich is the only way to lead a fulfilling life. I get this vibe from so many Content Marketers‚Äì from Gary Vee, Pat Flynn, John Somnez who is a Content Marketer who moonlights as a programmer. The tactics of Content Marketers bother me and seem like snake oil. This book is for people like Gary Vee and Pat Flynn and the If-you-don‚Äôt-wake-up-at-the-crack-of-dawn-and-write-a-book-you‚Äôll-never-be-successful types of overly precious articles by 20 somethings on Medium.I am old enough and jaded enough to know half of this stuff is complete bullshit.Do I want to have a lot of money? Sure. But there are other methods to go about it than these steps laid out in this book. The call to action to live a ‚Äúcharged‚Äù life is dubious at best. A charged life by whose standards? Burchard‚Äôs? Nahhh.He uses the term neuroscience quite loosely. He also turned me off with that pseudoscience word salad about health and diet. Another turn off was bringing spirituality into it but most of these books do that, and for me that‚Äôs a star deducted.Honestly, I should have listened to my gut and saved the $6.

      "content"	 : "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution - 25th Anniversary Edition by Steven LevyMy rating: 5 of 5 starsThis book was great in the sense it gave me insights into some of my favorite hackers (well, just two‚Äì Woz and Jobs). I am not sure why Steven included Jobs‚Äì he was more of a businessman and showman than an engineer and it showed in his work. He asked Woz to finish a project for him at Atari. Not the hacker type but if you‚Äôre going to dedicate a couple hours of the book on Apple Computer, it makes sense to include him.It also inspired me, as a new, self-taught engineer, to rethink math. I was really good at it but things delayed my learning, as well as being an arrogant teenager full of herself. I have since looked at B√©zier functions and have downloaded a few KU calc books.If you‚Äôd like insights on geeky geniuses who have literally shaped the world today, give it a listen/read. Not all of them are likeable (Richard Stallman) but their quirks are endearing, if you‚Äôre the geeky, introverted type.5 stars because I am into that sort of thing and Levy does a good job of cleaning up his earlier mistakes. I wish he would have maybe cut some of the main part of the book to include more about today‚Äôs hackers but still, a great read.View all my reviews",

I chose Carl Sagan as he is my skeptical hero and scientist ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù. I‚Äôve read one of his books and plenty of his essays and I just think the guy was amazing, smart, and could relay complicated scientific concepts to lay people.So I spent an hour working on the HTML and CSS. What I want to do is use jQuery to fade the quotes in and out when someone clicks on the page. So, essentially I need to have an even listener for mouse clicks, something like:$( ‚Äú#quote_1‚Äù ).click(function() {$( ‚Äúp‚Äù ).fadeIn( ‚Äúslow‚Äù, function() {// Animation complete});});$( ‚Äú#quote_1‚Äù ).click(function() {$( ‚Äúp‚Äù ).fadeOut( ‚Äúslow‚Äù, function() {// Animation complete.});});I also want to make the quotes float left and be in a block.

      "title": "The Danger of Type Coercion in JavaScript",
      "content"	 : "What is Type CoercionType coercion is essentially implicitly or explicitly changing the data type in JavaScript.You can do this in a couple of ways but first, let‚Äôs take a look at some ways the JavaScript engine tries to coerce types.Operator PrecedenceKnowing operator precedence is a must when working with any programming language. You can check out the MDN for information about operator precedence.The operators or operator functions we are going to use in these examples are &amp;lt; &amp;gt; + - * / == and ===.These operators are read from left-to-right in the JavaScript engine. The assignment operator = is read from right-to-left.Take a look at this code:var coerce = 1 &amp;lt; 2 &amp;lt; 3 &amp;lt; 4;console.log(coerce);Because we are using comparison operators, the console will return a Boolean value. In this case, when the code is run in the console, it returns true, like normal humans would assume.But look at this code:var coerce = 4 &amp;gt; 3 &amp;gt; 2 &amp;gt; 1;console.log(coerce);This is just reversing the order of the numbers and the comparison operators. Normally we‚Äôd assume this to be true. But check out the console:It returns false. Why? It‚Äôs coercion.When the JavaScript engine computates this code, remember, it will read it from left-to-right.In JavaScript, true and false have values, where true coerces to 1 and false coerces to 0.4 &amp;gt; 3 returns true. Now, JavaScript reads the next operation as 1 &amp;gt; 2 which is obviously going to return false. We then have false &amp;gt; 1 or 0 &amp;gt; 1 which is false.Coercion with Equality OperatorsEquality operators are the equality == and strict equality === operators. When we use the plain equality operator, we can coerce a string into a number, a number into a Boolean, etc. Take a look at this code:1 == &quot;1&quot;;Here we are saying the data type number is equal to the data type string which isn‚Äôt correct. But because we are using the ‚Äúnon-strict‚Äù equality operator, it coerces to true as we can see in the console:You can assume that strict equality, then, would yeild false if we were to enter this into the console:1 === &quot;1&quot;;ThoughtsThere are reasons to use coercion but typically it‚Äôs bad practice. Apparently some ES6 syntax takes some of the pain of coercion away, but as you can see, you could very well end up with hard to identify bugs in your code so it‚Äôs best to use strict equality when you are comparing something and consider operator precedence when using comparison operators.",

      "title": "Primitive Data Types in Java",
      "content"	 : "Variables in Java need to be declared before they can be used in Java because it is a statically-typed language. Because of this, you need to state the type of variable you are declaring.A variable‚Äôs data type tells Java what type of data the variable contains. For instance, an int contains an integer value. You can perform operations on the int data type like any other value number value.There are 8 primitive data types in Java. Primitive types are defined by Java and cannot be used elsewhere in your code. 1The primitive data types in Java are:  int: -231 -  231-1  short: -32,768 - 32,767 (inclusive)  byte: -128 - 127 (inclusive)  float:  decimal value  double: decimal value  long: -263 -  263-1  boolean: true or false values  char: Unicode characters - ‚Äòu0000‚Äô to ‚Äòuffff‚Äô or 0 - 65,535 (inclusive)LiteralsPrimitive data types are not objects instantiated from classes. You do not create a new one with the new keyword. Instead, you write the literal values of the data type when declaring and initilaizing the variables. For instance:public static void main(String[]args) {double balance = 0.00;char grade = &#39;B&#39;;Note: You need to use single quotes in the initialization of a Unicode character with the char data type.ThoughtsJava primitive data types are different than JavaScript data types. I will post more on JavaScript data types soon.            For instance, you cannot write String int = &quot;Integer&quot;; which is a convulted example but it stresses the point I‚Äôm trying to make.¬†&amp;#8617;      ",

    "array-methods-in-javascript": {
      "title": "Array Methods in JavaScript",
      "content"	 : "Different Types of MethodsThere are a few basic methods to work with arrays in JavaScript. The most basic and, perhaps the most familiar, is the .length() method.You can get the length of the elements in an array with with this method and a for loop, which is an iterator/counter loop. For more information about for loops, check here.An example of iterating through an array with a for loop to find the index of an element:var array = [&quot;Tiffany&quot;, &quot;Cheerios&quot;, &quot;ice cream&quot;, &quot;pig&quot;, &quot;Macbook&quot;];for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; array.length; i++) {var index = array[i];console.log(&#39;Index: &#39;, index);}This will list all the elements in the array to the console, as well as an undefined since I‚Äôm not returning a value.forEach() MethodAnother method worth noting is the forEach() method which is another iterator and perhaps more syntatic sugar than a for loop. It is worth mentioning that forEach() has perf costs and for large records and datasets, a for loop would be a better choice.An example of a forEach on an array would look like this:var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0];     array.forEach(function(item, index) {     console.log(item); });This does essentially the same thing as a for loop only it is cleaner and perhaps easier to use.map() MethodThis method creates a new method from elements in an old method using a callback function with three arguments: currentValue, index, and array.You can use map()to parse an array of objects or return a new array full of different number sets than the previous array. For instance:var even = [2,4,6,8];var odd = even.map(function(num) {return num + 1;});is something I could use to find and return a new array of odd numbers from an old array of even ones.concat() MethodThis method just concatenates two arrays into one. For instance:    var greetArr = [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World!&quot;],    jsArr = [&quot;Javascript&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;fun!&quot;];        var jsGreet = greetArr.concat(jsArr);        console.log(jsGreet);This will concatenate the arrays out to look like this:[&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World!&quot;, &quot;Javascript&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;fun!&quot;]While we don‚Äôt want the commas in between the words, this gives you a basic idea of what concat does.ThoughtsThese are just some of my favorite array methods for JavaScript. There are way more and you can find them in the Mozilla docs.",

",
      "content"	 : "First let me say, the class with Licence to Bill, my professor, kills it every class. Seriously. If you‚Äôre a Pitt student and haven‚Äôt taken him, do it. Like now. And get yourself an IDE. More on that later.We are moving along quickly right now. I am not even sure if we are doing Java I/O as I missed a class but whatever. Our first assignment was like a slap in the face to me last night after being out in the snow and cold for three hours waiting for the bus. I was exhausted and the instructions looked like gibberish.So I started on it today. Here are the instructions:You have opened a bookstore, and have decided to write your own point-of-sale system to sell books. You sell several items:    Books ($5.00 each)    Bookmarks ($1.00 each, or a pack of six for $5.00)    Paintings of Books ($100.00 each)Customers can purchase any number of each item. However, if a customer purchases bookmarks, it will always give them packs if possible, thus allowing for a cheaper price. For example, if somebody buys 3 bookmarks, they will not buy a pack - it will cost them $3.00. However, if they buy 7, then they will automatically get one pack and one extra bookmark, for a total cost of $5.00 + $1.00 = $6.00 - not $7.00.We will assume that you are operating the bookstore in Oakland, so you will need to add 7% additional tax (Pennsylvania and Allegheny County taxes) on all sales. For example, if somebody buys one book at $5.00, then the total cost should be $5.00 + $0.35 in tax, or $5.35.All values should be rounded to the nearest cent.Additionally, in order to attract business, you are running a promotion: every third customer will get 10% off their order (before tax). This will start with the third customer; the first customer will not get a discount, the second customer will not get a discount, but the third one, sixth one, ninth one, etc. will. For example, if the third customer buys a book, they would get $0.50 off (10% of $5.00), for a total of $4.50, and then tax would be added ($4.185, which would be rounded to $4.82).If the customer does not get a discount, then along with the receipt, the message ‚ÄúYou did not get a discount! Better luck next time!‚Äù If the customer does get a discount, display the discount amount and the message ‚ÄúYou won a 10% discount!‚ÄùYou will write a Java program that runs a point-of-sale service for your bookstore. The program should do the following:    Ask if another customer is waiting in line, and have the user enter an integer - 1 for yes and 2 for no.    If no customers are waiting in line, exit the program.    Show the customer a menu which has all items and their prices listed, as well as options to show the current order and check out. Customers should be able to modify their order (for example, if they accidentally enter that they want to purchase four books, then put one back, they should be able to modify that to three books).    Showing the current order should show how many of each item the customer is going to purchase.    Checking out will consist of showing a tabulated receipt with how many of each item was purchased. If an item was not purchased, it should not display (so there should be no ‚ÄúBooks: 0 $0.00‚Äù lines. If the ‚ÄúThird Customer Discount‚Äù was applied, it should show that as a separate (before tax) line. It should include a subtotal (before tax), and then a total (after tax).    Finally, ask the user to pay for it. The system should accept a floating-point number from the user. If it is less than the cost of the customer‚Äôs purchase, the system should print ‚ÄúNot enough money - please re-enter‚Äù and ask again. The system should continue to do this until a valid amount of money (the cost of the total or greater) is entered. Once a valid amount of money is entered, indicate the change given (for example, if the purchase is $96.50 and the customer gives $100.00, show that the change should be $3.50).I sat down at the IDE. My mind drew a blank. I had to look at examples and old snippets in SnippetsLab to get a sense of syntax. This makes no sense to me as I was tweaking code just last week. ¬Ø(„ÉÑ)/¬ØAnyway, I got it rolling. Bill‚Äôs code samples gave me a jumpstart and I have a working loop. I can‚Äôt really share too much code here as we have mandatory private GitHub repositories to work in but I will share a screenshot of my IDE, which brings me to my next point‚Ä¶IDEs. They‚Äôre Extraordinary.In the last¬†post, I mentioned getting a screenshot of IntelliJ IDEA from a guy in Slack. I tried to get it working but still couldn‚Äôt get it to debug. I did some GoogleFu and found out that I didn‚Äôt have the root directory specified and how to set up a module configuration. I then did this for WebStorm, where I do my JavaScript coding and am off to the races. Even my theme works now.I seriously underestimated the power of the IDE. Of course, it is a tool like anything else and can be used as a crutch instead of a learning tool. But I know aboutSystem.out.println();I just think it‚Äôs far more efficient to get the runtime and compile errors without muddying up my code with a bunch of println statements. Setting breakpoints solves that issue.Bill doesn‚Äôt want those .idea folders or .iml files so I added them to my gitignore file and none of those were upload to the repository. Use your gitignore files, friends!First let me say, the class with Licence to Bill, my professor, kills it every class. Seriously. If you‚Äôre a Pitt student and haven‚Äôt taken him, do it. Like now.

For example, if somebody buys one book at $5.00, then the total cost should be $5.00 + $0.35 in tax, or $5.35.All values should be rounded to the nearest cent.Additionally, in order to attract business, you are running a promotion: every third customer will get 10% off their order (before tax). This will start with the third customer; the first customer will not get a discount, the second customer will not get a discount, but the third one, sixth one, ninth one, etc. will. For example, if the third customer buys a book, they would get $0.50 off (10% of $5.00), for a total of $4.50, and then tax would be added ($4.185, which would be rounded to $4.82).If the customer does not get a discount, then along with the receipt, the message ‚ÄúYou did not get a discount! Better luck next time!‚Äù If the customer does get a discount, display the discount amount and the message ‚ÄúYou won a 10% discount!‚ÄùYou will write a Java program that runs a point-of-sale service for your bookstore. The program should do the following:    Ask if another customer is waiting in line, and have the user enter an integer - 1 for yes and 2 for no.    If no customers are waiting in line, exit the program.    Show the customer a menu which has all items and their prices listed, as well as options to show the current order and check out. Customers should be able to modify their order (for example, if they accidentally enter that they want to purchase four books, then put one back, they should be able to modify that to three books).    Showing the current order should show how many of each item the customer is going to purchase.    Checking out will consist of showing a tabulated receipt with how many of each item was purchased. If an item was not purchased, it should not display (so there should be no ‚ÄúBooks: 0 $0.00‚Äù lines. If the ‚ÄúThird Customer Discount‚Äù was applied, it should show that as a separate (before tax) line. It should include a subtotal (before tax), and then a total (after tax).    Finally, ask the user to pay for it. The system should accept a floating-point number from the user. If it is less than the cost of the customer‚Äôs purchase, the system should print ‚ÄúNot enough money - please re-enter‚Äù and ask again. The system should continue to do this until a valid amount of money (the cost of the total or greater) is entered. Once a valid amount of money is entered, indicate the change given (for example, if the purchase is $96.50 and the customer gives $100.00, show that the change should be $3.50).I sat down at the IDE. My mind drew a blank. I had to look at examples and old snippets in SnippetsLab to get a sense of syntax. This makes no sense to me as I was tweaking code just last week. ¬Ø(„ÉÑ)/¬ØAnyway, I got it rolling. Bill‚Äôs code samples gave me a jumpstart and I have a working loop. I can‚Äôt really share too much code here as we have mandatory private GitHub repositories to work in but I will share a screenshot of my IDE, which brings me to my next point‚Ä¶IDEs. They‚Äôre Extraordinary.In the last¬†post, I mentioned getting a screenshot of IntelliJ IDEA from a guy in Slack. I tried to get it working but still couldn‚Äôt get it to debug. I did some GoogleFu and found out that I didn‚Äôt have the root directory specified and how to set up a module configuration. I then did this for WebStorm, where I do my JavaScript coding and am off to the races. Even my theme works now.I seriously underestimated the power of the IDE. Of course, it is a tool like anything else and can be used as a crutch instead of a learning tool. But I know aboutSystem.out.println();I just think it‚Äôs far more efficient to get the runtime and compile errors without muddying up my code with a bunch of println statements. Setting breakpoints solves that issue.Bill doesn‚Äôt want those .idea folders or .iml files so I added them to my gitignore file and none of those were upload to the repository. Use your gitignore files, friends!I have a lot of respect for the text editors I‚Äôve worked in and I probably will stick with VS Code and the plethora of excellent JavaScript tooling modules out there for writing JavaScript heavy apps, no offense to WebStorm. But for code that doesn‚Äôt have the tooling JavaScript has, I will stick with IDEs like IntelliJ and RubyMine.",

For example:// An array of intsvar array = [45, 37, 69, 90];// An array of Boolean valuesvar array = [true, false];// An array of Stringsvar array = [&quot;Mom&quot;, &quot;Rick&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;];Hetergeneous Arrays‚Ä¶Can contain a mixture of data types. For example:var anArray = [&quot;peaches&quot;, 9, &quot;cream&quot;, false];Multidimensional ArraysA multidimensional array is just an array of arrays. Think of them as nested arrays. For example:var myArray = [[&quot;Mom&quot;, 71, &quot;Me&quot;, 36], [&quot;John&quot;, 40], [true]];Jagged ArraysA jagged array is an array that looks like a multidimesional array but does not have a particular order. They  look like this:var myArray = [     [&quot;Jerri&quot;, 70, &quot;Tiffany&quot;],     [&quot;37&quot;],     [&quot;John&quot;, false], ];An Empty ArrayIs an array with nothing in it. For example:var anArray = [];This is useful for loops and adding data later to your program.These are the types of arrays in JavaScript. I will cover arrays in Java as well.",

      "content"	 : "This will be a series on working with arrays. Not sure how long it will be but there is so much rich information about arrays in JavaScript that I don‚Äôt think I could fit it all into one post. It may not be a series after all; I may just revisit the topic every now and again.ArraysAn array is an object in JavaScript. It is a global object set out in a list between two brackets []. Elements in an array are separated by a comma. An array can have any type of data, in any order, inside of the brackets.For instance:var myArray = [&quot;John&quot;, 39, &quot;Tiffany&quot;, 37, false];is a typical array. Usually we can get the index, or position, of a piece of data in an array by bracket or dot notation.Arrays in JavaScript can have a mixture of data types; in my example above I mix strings, numbers, and a boolean data type in one array.Initializing an ArrayYou can initialize an array as follows:var myArray = [10];You can also initalize an empty array such as:var emptyArray = [];This is useful for having a place to hold values that will be initialized later in your code.Accessing Array ElementsYou can access array elements by their index in the console. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, much like Java and other languages. An example of the syntax:var indexOfArray = [&quot;Jerri&quot;, 69, &quot;Tiffany&quot; 37, false];console.log(indexOfArray[4]); // This would return the boolean value &#39;false&#39;console.log(indexOfArray.[2]); // This is accessing an array with dot notation. // This would return &#39;Tiffany&#39;console.log(indexOfArray.1); // This isn&#39;t proper syntax as properties that begin with // a number can&#39;t be accessed using dot notationconsole.log(indexOfArray.0); // This is okay as it is a stringThe .length PropertyYou can see how many items are in an array with the .length property. The syntax is similar to accessing an index with dot notation:var howMany = [&quot;Jerri&quot;, 69, &quot;Tiffany&quot; 37, false];console.log(howMany.length); // this will return 5 as there are 5 items in the array.// Not to be confused with *indeces*These are some basic facts about JavaScript arrays.

      "content"	 : "‚ÄúLaughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning do to do afterward.‚Äù ‚Äï Kurt VonnegutThere comes a point in every new programmers life when they hit a barrier, a wall, a threshold of understanding or non-understanding of the material at hand.I hit that threshold yesterday.And the day before it. It was a solution so simple; I had the right idea several times. I got explained to and encouraged, and guided and it was like their words were bouncing off my skull instead of being absorbed into my grey matter. The question was:Check if a string (first argument) ends with the given target string (second argument).Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.Here are some helpful links:String.substr()The given code:function end(str, target) { // &amp;quot;Never give up and good luck will find you.&amp;quot; // -- Falcor return str;}end(&amp;quot;Bastian&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;);function end(str, target) { // &amp;quot;Never give up and good luck will find you.&amp;quot; // -- Falcor return str;}end(&amp;quot;Bastian&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;);What the Hell Substrings?You‚Äôve done it before and you can do it now. See the positive possibilities. Redirect the substantial energy of your frustration and turn it into positive, effective, unstoppable determination. ‚ÄìRalph MarstonI knew that, since we had lengths of different strings. The tests proved that. So I kept hardcoding for one particular string. I couldn‚Äôt get past that. How do I code this thing for different string lengths? How do you get the length of a string? .length. Right? YES. But how. Where do I put the .length? I had this code:function end(str, target) { //&amp;quot;Never give up and good luck will find you.&amp;quot; // -- Falcor//dees [8:42 PM]//&#39;abcdefghijklmn&#39;.substr(0, 3) // &#39;abc&#39;//&amp;quot;grab 3 characters starting with the character at address number 0&amp;quot;‚Äã var isEqual = str.substr(6, 1) === target.substr(0, 1); return isEqual;}‚Äãfunction end(str, target) { //&amp;quot;Never give up and good luck will find you.&amp;quot; // -- Falcor//dees [8:42 PM]//&#39;abcdefghijklmn&#39;.substr(0, 3) // &#39;abc&#39;//&amp;quot;grab 3 characters starting with the character at address number 0&amp;quot;‚Äã var isEqual = str.substr(6, 1) === target.substr(0, 1); return isEqual;}‚Äãend(&amp;quot;Bastian&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;);I found out in Free Code Camp‚Äôs Gitter chat that you can get to the end of a string with a negative number; no need to keep popping off all those letters before the ‚Äún‚Äù on Bastian. But I continued to hard code for ‚ÄúBastian‚Äù and ‚Äún‚Äù. I needed a broader approach.I tried:function end(str, target) {‚Äã var isEqual = str.substr(-1) === target.substr(-1); return isEqual;}‚Äãfunction end(str, target) {‚Äã var isEqual = str.substr(-1) === target.substr(-1); return isEqual;}‚Äãend(&amp;quot;Bastian&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;);But I wasn‚Äôt really making any progress. All but one of the tests were passing, and I wasn‚Äôt really utilizing .length to have a basic variance of string lengths. So I did this:function end(str, target) { var n = target.length; var z = str.length; var isEqual = str.substr(-1) === target.substr(-1); return isEqual;}‚Äãfunction end(str, target) { var n = target.length; var z = str.length; var isEqual = str.substr(-1) === target.substr(-1); return isEqual;}‚Äãend(&amp;quot;Bastian&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;);Same result. I knew I needed to have .length; up there. But where to go after that?Aha!Finally, I had to be guided to the answer. The woman was in Britain and I am pretty sure I was keeping her awake. So we came up with this solution:function end(str, target) { // &amp;quot;Never give up and good luck will find you.&amp;quot; // -- Falcor var length = target.length; var isEqual = target === str.substr(-length); return isEqual;}end(&amp;quot;Bastian&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;);function end(str, target) { // &amp;quot;Never give up and good luck will find you.&amp;quot; // -- Falcor var length = target.length; var isEqual = target === str.substr(-length); return isEqual;}end(&amp;quot;Bastian&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;n&amp;quot;);var length = target.length; gets the length of any target string and assigns it to the length variable.var isEqual = target === str.substr(-length); compares the target string with the original string, subtracting the last characters of the length variable, starting with the end of the string.I hope I explained that right. I understand it. It takes a bit to look at and understand but when we came to that solution, I felt like a complete idiot.I cried. I literally did. Part of that is just me already being emotional. The other part is me not wanting to put my fist through my MacBook Pro screen. Strings are characters. Not words. And I was totally getting stuck on that.Bonfire tears indeed.",

    "iterating-over-an-array-in-java-and-javascript-3": {
      "title": "Iterating Over an Array in Java and JavaScript",
      "content"	 : "I have learned that while Java and JavaScript are different, they share similarities. Someone in the Code Newbie Slack informed me of the history of JavaScript and how the creators had borrowed some functionality from Java. That‚Äôs for another post on another blog.But while I was reading my textbook chapter on arrays, I noticed that you can iterate through an array in Java much like you can in JavaScript.Arrays in Java are initialized completely differently as you must specify a data type and the slots you allocate in the array cannot be changed, as such, it is immutable. Here is an example of an array in Java:int[] myArray;myArray = new int[10];This declares the array then initializes it with 10 int spots.An array in JavaScript looks like this:var myArray = [&quot;Jerri&quot;, 69, &quot;Tiffany&quot;, 37, &quot;John&quot;, 39]How Interating Through Arrays in Java and JavaScript Are SimilarSo, I first got a taste of iterating through an array in JavaScript while working the Bonfires at Free Code Camp, which use algorithms to help you better understand the ins and outs of the language. One of the ways you can iterate through an array in JavaScript is by a for loop and a .length method depending on what you need. Here is the syntax of an algorithm I wrote in order to find out if a word was a palindrome or not:function palindrome(str) { str = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[W_]/g, &quot;&quot;);   for(var i = 0, len = str.length - 1; i &amp;lt;= len/2; i++) {     if(str[i] !== str[len-i]) {       return false;     }   } return true;}function palindrome(str) {  str = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[W_]/g, &amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;);   for(var i = 0, len = str.length - 1; i &amp;amp;amp;lt; len/2; i++) {     if(str[i] !== str[len-i]) {       return false;     }  } return true;}palindrome(&quot;eye&quot;);Breaking It DownThe first part of this algorithm is turning all the letters in the string to lowercase and then using regex to get rid of capital letters, spaces, and punctuation[2].The next part checks each index of the array to see if it is the same later, going inwards until it reached half the length of the array. If they are the same letter, then it‚Äôs a palindrome and will return true.Same with Java‚Ä¶in a WayThe for loop in a Java array iteration looks the same when you just break it down into the method body. For instance:public static void showArray(int[] array){ for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; array.length; i++) System.out.print(array[i] + &quot; &quot;);}Here, when the showValue method is called, an element of the array is passed to the method. It will loop through and print out each value of the elements of the array. Here we are printing it out. In the JavaScript example, we were cycling through the array to test for similarities.The parallel? You can cycle through, and get elements/indeces of arrays with a for loop.",

      "content"	 : "The Java is getting harder now. I was tasked with making a dice rolling game with these instructions:This is a dice game (each roll uses two die = 2 dice) that you are going to create in the command line console. The rules are as follows:A new shooter (player) begins with his first dice roll (2 die = 2 dice). This is known as the ‚Äúbig start roll.‚ÄùIf the shooter rolls a 5 or 10 the player wins.If the shooter rolls a 2, 4 or 11, the player loses.If the shooter rolls any other number, the ‚Äúbig start roll‚Äù becomes the ‚Äúmatch number.‚ÄùThe shooter must continue to roll the dice until either one of two things happens:The shooter rolls a 5, and he loses.The shooter rolls the ‚Äúmatch number‚Äù again, and he wins.Grading for the project is as follows. You are to have each partial-credit activity reviewed during attendance-required recitation. This counts toward your participation grade in the course. You CANNOT skip partial-credit activities. You work at your own pace, and you can submit project work to this CourseWeb hyperlink for grading as many times as you like up to, and including, the due date/time - only the latest submission is graded. Based on the passing of each partial-credit activity, you earn the following grade:No activity passed, 0% FActivity 1 passed, 65% DActivity 1 &amp;amp; 2 passed, 75% CActivity 1, 2 &amp;amp; 3 passed, 85% BActivity 1, 2, 3, &amp;amp; 4 passed, 95% AActivity 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp;amp; 5 passed, 100% A+Each partial-credit activity builds upon each other, and you may have to rework/rewrite source code to complete the more difficult partial-credit activity. This should NOT be a GUI program - it is text-based.So, I had to think about this. There was an particular activity I was stuck on. I made notes that looked like this:// Two variables, one bigStartRoll, secondRoll// Display result using System.out.println// Use conditional statement (if bigStartRoll == 5 || 10, etc) to determine if game is won on bigStartRoll// Display whether the user has won on first roll using System.out.println// Use else in the conditional if statement to determine if further action is needed for the game to be won// if the condition is false, print out what needs to be done to win using System.out.printlnand**Need to create a class and methods.**I asked the TA if I needed to create classes and methods. She said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù.Great.Wasting Time‚ÄúYour hand can seize today, but not tomorrow; and thoughts of your tomorrow are nothing but desire.

I had, evenutally, a block of messy code. I was listless and decided to get help from Code Newbies.Someone in their Slack room helped tremendously. He said, ‚ÄúYou have these complicated instructions and this big block of code. When things are complicated we need to break them down into pieces.‚Äù I knew he meant methods, something I asked my TA about. He rearranged my code and we went through the process, what was happening, what methods were being called where. He eventually had to feed his kids and I was left to figure out how to get the program to keep running when certain conditions were met. I figured it out myself.

      "title": "The Execution Stack and Scope",
      "content"	 : "What is the Execution Stack? Before I answer that question, we‚Äôll first have to take a look at the Global Execution ContextThe Global Execution Context, in general terms, is the environment in which the function gets invoked, or the variable‚Äôs scope. The Global Execution Context, creates global object, a window object, and a this variable in its creation phase as well as storing any variables you‚Äôve made stored in memory.The first function gets created on the global execution context called an, as you probably guessed, execution context and has its own space for variables and functions. The global execution context reads line by line until it comes to the next function. Every function creates a new execution context. Once there are no more functions to execute the top function on the execution context gets popped off. Whatever is at the top is currently running.The Global Execution Context, then, is the outer portion of the Execution Stack or Call Stack. The functions that are invoked in the Execution Stack are lexically sitting on top of one another and being called from top to bottom. JavaScript is a synchronous language, which means the code you write gets executed line by line, from top to bottom.Talking About the Scope ChainSo how do the execution stack and the scope chain come together? It depends on where the function sits lexically. Take a look at this code:function myFunction() {console.log(myVar);}function yourFunction() {var myVar = 68;yourFunction();}var myVar = 37;myFunction();The execution stack has to search for the variables you defined and where you defined them, making references to the outer lexical environment. This is called the scope chain.When this code is executed, since the scope chain can‚Äôt find myVar in function yourFunction() because it isn‚Äôt lexically in the local scope (remember your scopes) and the outer reference is in the global execution context, the console.log will display 37.If we were to change where function yourFunction() sits lexically in the execution stack, for instance:function myFunction() {function yourFunction() {console.log(myVar);}var myVar = 68;yourFunction();}var myVar = 37;myFunction();Everything is created along the same lines. The global execution context is created, myFunction() sits on top of the global execution context, yourFunction() sits on top of it. But when the scope chain looks for its outer reference lexical environment this time, yourFunction()‚Äôs outer reference lexical environment is myFunction() because yourFunction() sits lexically inside of it.This is how, under the hood, local and global scope function.

      "title": "Scope for Beginners",
      "content"	 : "In JavaScript, lexical scope deals with where your variables are defined, and how they will be accessible‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor not accessible‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto the rest of your code.There are two terms to think about when talking about scope: local and global. These two terms are important to understand, because one can be more dangerous than the other when declaring variables and executing your code.Global ScopeA variable is globally scoped if you declare it outside of all of your functions. For example://global variable, i.e. global scopevar a = &quot;foo&quot;;function myFunction() {  var b = &quot;bar&quot;;  console.log(a+b);}myFunction();When a variable is in the global scope, it can be accessed by all the code in the same JavaScript file. In this example, I‚Äôm accessing the variable a in my console.log statement, inside the myFunction function.Local ScopeLocal variables only exist inside functions. They are scoped to that individual function.You can think of local variables as as any variables that fall between an opening and closing curly brace.These local variables can‚Äôt be accessed by code outside of the function to which they belong.Take a look at this code://global variable, i.e. global scopevar a = &quot;foo&quot;;function myFunction() {  //local variable, or local scope  var b = &quot;bar&quot;;  console.log(a+b);}function yourFunction() {  var c = &quot;JavaScript is fun!&quot;;  return c;  console.log(c);}myFunction();yourFunction();Notice how the variables are each declared inside separate functions. They are both local variables, in local scope, and can‚Äôt be accessed by one other.For instance, I can‚Äôt return b in yourFunction, because b belongs to myFunction. b can‚Äôt be accessed by yourFunction, and vice versa.If I were to try to return the value of b when calling yourFunction, I‚Äôd get ‚Äúerror: b is not defined.‚Äù Why? Because b doesn‚Äôt belong to yourFunction. b is outside of yourFunction‚Äôs scope.When adding nested conditionals, scope gets even more hairy. But I‚Äôll leave that for another time.But for now, remember the difference between global scope and local scope. And the next time you get a ‚Äúis not defined‚Äù error, check the variable‚Äôs scope.",

      "content"	 : "Traversing the DOMSo I learned more about traversing the DOM with JavaScript instead of the sugary jQuery library which makes me feel great. I like jQuery and all, but knowing how to code something in pure JavaScript is something I think every new developer needs to learn and learn before learning any libraries or learning concurrently with JavaScript, like Treehouse does with it‚Äôs jQuery and JavaScript courses.One of my favorite things about this was instead of having to use theonclick();event handler to traverse a certain part of the DOM (when something is clicked) you could listen for any type of click events withaddEventListenerto listen for a click on an element specified as the argument to the method. For instance here:addButton.onclick = addTask;//Set the click handler to the addTask functionaddButton.addEventListener(&amp;amp;quot;click&amp;amp;quot;, addTask);addButton.addEventListener(&amp;amp;quot;click&amp;amp;quot;, ajaxRequest);addButton.onclick = addTask;//Set the click handler to the addTask functionaddButton.addEventListener(&amp;amp;quot;click&amp;amp;quot;, addTask);addButton.addEventListener(&amp;amp;quot;click&amp;amp;quot;, ajaxRequest);This is much faster and easier than traversiing each element with theonclick();method.Welcome Aboard Nick Lash as a New Contributor to the BlogNick and I connected on LinkedIn and, impressed with my social media and blogging output, reached out to me to collaborate on the blog and my podcast which you can find here.

When working with opening text files, writing text to those text files, and then reading the text back into the program, I got stuck with scope. And I knew it. It wasn‚Äôt like I was flying blind without knowing my problem which, after a year of doing this, I am pretty proud of. I still couldn‚Äôt figure out where my issue was. I went to Stack Overflow, I asked around. For one, this is what my code looked like prior to getting it corrected:import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.*;public class White{ public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {   // Gets the PrintWriter and Scanner classes   PrintWriter file = new PrintWriter(&amp;amp;quot;names.txt&amp;amp;quot;);   Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);   // Gets data and writes it to a file  for (int i = 1; i &amp;amp;lt;= 3; i++) {    //Gets name of friend    System.out.print(&amp;amp;quot;Enter the name of friend number &amp;amp;quot; + i + &amp;amp;quot;: &amp;amp;quot;);    String friendName = keyboard.nextLine();    file.println(friendName); }    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(&amp;amp;quot;names.txt&amp;amp;quot;, true);    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);    for (int i = 4; i &amp;amp;lt;= 6; i++)    {        //Gets name of friend        System.out.print(&amp;amp;quot;Enter the name of friend number &amp;amp;quot; + i + &amp;amp;quot;: &amp;amp;quot;);        String friendName = keyboard.nextLine();        file.println(friendName);    }    file.close();  }import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.*;public class White{ public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {   // Gets the PrintWriter and Scanner classes   PrintWriter file = new PrintWriter(&amp;amp;quot;names.txt&amp;amp;quot;);   Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);   // Gets data and writes it to a file  for (int i = 1; i &amp;amp;lt;= 3; i++) {    //Gets name of friend    System.out.print(&amp;amp;quot;Enter the name of friend number &amp;amp;quot; + i + &amp;amp;quot;: &amp;amp;quot;);    String friendName = keyboard.nextLine();    file.println(friendName); }    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(&amp;amp;quot;names.txt&amp;amp;quot;, true);    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);    for (int i = 4; i &amp;amp;lt;= 6; i++)    {        //Gets name of friend        System.out.print(&amp;amp;quot;Enter the name of friend number &amp;amp;quot; + i + &amp;amp;quot;: &amp;amp;quot;);        String friendName = keyboard.nextLine();        file.println(friendName);    }    file.close();  }}As you can see I was trying to access a variable outside it‚Äôs scopeString friendName = keyboard.nextLine();. I declared it twice as well. I knew I needed to change the variable to be outside of all the loops, global (but not quite, as I was told about the resulting code, not sure why) sort of. I would declare it right after the method but the compiler complained that I did not initializeString friendName;. And I didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt know how.So frustrated, I jumped on the Code Newbie Slack general channel and just threw it out there. Most are web developers but someone helped. Cory. He told me to initialize it with empty single quotes. The compiler didn‚Äôt understand the empty single quotes so I changed them to an empty string with double quotes. Here is the final program, which isn‚Äôt elegant, but I still got a 100 anyway, as it was just for participation:import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.*;public class White{ public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {   // Gets the PrintWriter and Scanner classes   PrintWriter file = new PrintWriter(&amp;amp;quot;names.txt&amp;amp;quot;);   Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);   String friendName = &amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;;   // Gets data and writes it to a file   for (int i = 1; i &amp;amp;lt;= 3; i++) {     //Gets name of friend     System.out.print(&amp;amp;quot;Enter the name of friend number &amp;amp;quot; + i + &amp;amp;quot;: &amp;amp;quot;);     friendName = keyboard.nextLine();     file.println(friendName);     System.out.println(friendName); }    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(&amp;amp;quot;names.txt&amp;amp;quot;, true);    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);    for (int i = 4; i &amp;amp;lt;= 6; i++)    {        //Gets name of friend        System.out.print(&amp;amp;quot;Enter the name of friend number &amp;amp;quot; + i + &amp;amp;quot;: &amp;amp;quot;);        friendName = keyboard.nextLine();        file.println(friendName);        System.out.println(friendName);    }    file.close();  }import java.util.Scanner;import java.io.*;public class White{ public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {   // Gets the PrintWriter and Scanner classes   PrintWriter file = new PrintWriter(&amp;amp;quot;names.txt&amp;amp;quot;);   Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);   String friendName = &amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot;;   // Gets data and writes it to a file   for (int i = 1; i &amp;amp;lt;= 3; i++) {     //Gets name of friend     System.out.print(&amp;amp;quot;Enter the name of friend number &amp;amp;quot; + i + &amp;amp;quot;: &amp;amp;quot;);     friendName = keyboard.nextLine();     file.println(friendName);     System.out.println(friendName); }    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(&amp;amp;quot;names.txt&amp;amp;quot;, true);    PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fw);    for (int i = 4; i &amp;amp;lt;= 6; i++)    {        //Gets name of friend        System.out.print(&amp;amp;quot;Enter the name of friend number &amp;amp;quot; + i + &amp;amp;quot;: &amp;amp;quot;);        friendName = keyboard.nextLine();        file.println(friendName);        System.out.println(friendName);    }    file.close();  }}Fin.

I do have some gen eds to take so I am taking Chinese Thought this semester and will probably have to take a language course.

I always knew I was university material. Always. I may not have been able to go when I was young because of circumstances well out of my control but deep down I knew I could go, when I got my stuff together.So I am in my fifth week and I have homework like mad. Ha. I am excited to do it.We are doing file input and output in Java. We are writing to a text file with FileWriter. You can also append text to a file doing PrintWriter.

You then declare thePrintWriterclass to append the proceeding lines to the the text file.pWriter.close()closes the file in a similar way that Python closes text files after you open and append text to them.Update: Seems, after I went to class today, that you open a file withPrintWriterand append to a file usingFileWriterI guess I got confused there reading that code from UT.",

I also reached out to Stack Overflow for an answer: how do you escape and % sign in a format string? I knew  plus a letter escapes a lot of line breaks and characters but it doesn‚Äôt escape a % sign in a format string. So how do you escape a % sign? With 2 % signs. Interesting.I got to experience the thrill of debugging something myself. That feeling was satisfying. I am learning.So what does my first Java program look like?

",
      "content"	 : "The Blank Text EditorSo class is moving along at a regular clip. I am learning about syntax and seeing similarities between other languages. I have written four text-based programs using Java that were pretty easy, seeing as I already have some clue as to how to code. Today, however, she threw us into the fire and, like many times before, I opened up a blank Atom text document and froze.Fear of Getting It WrongI know I am going to write bugs. Everyone does. No one gets it write the first time. But sitting there at my Mac, staring at Atom, knowing I had a day to complete calculating the average of three test scores and then printing the average to the screen using two decimal places stopped me in my tracks. We just learned about formatters, which I was familiar with in Python, but there was this extra way to format. For instance, take the number 5,876.98. You could format this like: public class Tax Ripoff{ public static void main(String[] args)  {  double grossPay = 5876.98  double netPay = 5489.76  double differenceInPay = grossPay - netPay;  System.out.printf(&amp;amp;quot;The difference between your gross and net pay is %,.2fn&amp;amp;quot;, differenceInPay);  }} public class Tax Ripoff{ public static void main(String[] args)  {  double grossPay = 5876.98  double netPay = 5489.76  double differenceInPay = grossPay - netPay;  System.out.printf(&amp;amp;quot;The difference between your gross and net pay is %,.2fn&amp;amp;quot;, differenceInPay);  }}I don&amp;#8217;t know if they have that in Python, but it looks pretty silly and verbose to me.Anyway.I completely froze up. I do it all the time. I am a perfectionist. To a fault. This can&amp;#8217;t happen if I am to get anything done. So I looked at my professor&amp;#8217;s code and my old code and started coding.BugsRan into a bug. Thanks to Bill Laboon for his help debugging. I kept getting an exception error. I was using &amp;#8220;%,.2f&amp;#8221; when my numbers didn&amp;#8217;t require a comma&amp;#8211; they weren&amp;#8217;t big enough.

We had WiCStart and I really wanted to write a blog post on it but I was so overwhelmed by just the one day I went that I laid in bed and did pretty much nothing for a whole week. There are reasons for this that go beyond the scope of this blog. Just know that I was a success early, then a failure, leading a pretty mediocre existence for the end of my teens and my whole 20 something years. Going to WiCStart and realizing that at the end of my CS degree I won‚Äôt be poor and I‚Äôll have a great job and be able to send my mother who is poor (by government standards but she‚Äôs alright for the most part) a check every month, that I won‚Äôt be just another statistic and a casualty of my sociological caste status really scares me and excites me and I don‚Äôt know where to put all those emotions. So I stayed in bed. Success, succeeding. I‚Äôve done that. I also fell flat on my face through nothing I could control. It got so bad at one point I thought about selling drugs just to eat. That was years ago. I have been desperate. I have been seriously clinically depressed among other things. I have had to fight for my life numerous times. To know I won‚Äôt have to do that, not anymore elates and terrifies me because I don‚Äôt know if I fail if I‚Äôll go back to where I was. Being in that place is not fun and more terrifying than failing itself.So that‚Äôs out of the way. WiCStart at the University of Pittsburgh was amazing. Knowing that they are throwing money at women to take on CS degrees makes me relieved because that means I won‚Äôt have to quit mid-schooling because I no longer get aid and can‚Äôt afford it. Pitt is a good CS school, ranking in the top 30% in the country, and graduates get heavily recruited by local companies and make bank right out of the gate. Recent grads have made $86k right after graduation. The average is $67k.Tomorrow I start my first university class after being at a community college for longer than I care to admit. Then I was young and really depressed and just couldn‚Äôt get myself together to finish classes. Once I was 30 things started looking up. I know CCs and Universities are on different levels and I am excited and nervous all at once. I have been waiting for this day for months and now it is here tomorrow. The day will be long but I was assured by counselors that having ample time between classes is normal and that you can do all sorts of stuff during that time. So I‚Äôll be taking my MacBook Pro with me every class day.So I haven‚Äôt programmed all last week. We had WiCStart and I really wanted to write a blog post on it but I was so overwhelmed by just the one day I went that I laid in bed and did pretty much nothing for a whole week. There are reasons for this that go beyond the scope of this blog. Just know that I was a success early, then a failure, leading a pretty mediocre existence for the end of my teens and my whole 20 something years. Going to WiCStart and realizing that at the end of my CS degree I won‚Äôt be poor and I‚Äôll have a great job and be able to send my mother who is poor (by government standards but she‚Äôs alright for the most part) a check every month, that I won‚Äôt be just another statistic and a casualty of my sociological caste status really scares me and excites me and I don‚Äôt know where to put all those emotions.

Usually you don‚Äôt writewindow.documentto access the document, (which is part of the DOM or Document Object Model).The DOM is basically the HTML document, arranged in a tree, with nodes that you can manipulate with JavaScript and jQuery.HTML TablesSelf-explanatory really.

      "content"	 : "We used more HTML5 and JavaScript in this exercise. We had an HTML5&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/canvas&amp;gt;element which we have to use JavaScript interactivity to; we can‚Äôt use pure jQuery to make this app work so if JavaScript is disabled, the app won‚Äôt work.We used new event handlers like$canvas.mousedown(function(e) { lastEvent = e; mouseDown = true;}).mousemove(function(e) {}).mouseup(function() {}).mouseleave(function() {});$canvas.mousedown(function(e) { lastEvent = e; mouseDown = true;}).mousemove(function(e) {}).mouseup(function() {}).mouseleave(function() {});Obviously this code doesn‚Äôt work in its current state, but I digress. So drawing the line in the app consists of.mousedown() .mousemove() .mouseup() .mouseleave()so when you click initally, mousedown, move the mouse, mousemove, release the button on the mouse, mouseup, and when the mouse leaves the DOM element it was bound to, mouseleave, which won‚Äôt make an awkward line when the mouse comes back into the DOM element.Learned new methods like.siblings()which will access the siblings in a child element and execute an event handler or another method.We learned JavaScript specific ways to make the canvas interactive. The code looks like this:$canvas.mousedown(function(e) { lastEvent = e; mouseDown = true;}).mousemove(function(e) { if(mouseDown) { context.beginPath(); context.moveTo(lastEvent.offsetX, lastEvent.offsetY); context.lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY); context.strokeStyle = color; context.stroke(); lastEvent = e; }}).mouseup(function() { mouseDown = false;}).mouseleave(function() { $canvas.mouseup$canvas.mousedown(function(e) { lastEvent = e; mouseDown = true;}).mousemove(function(e) { if(mouseDown) { context.beginPath(); context.moveTo(lastEvent.offsetX, lastEvent.offsetY); context.lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY); context.strokeStyle = color; context.stroke(); lastEvent = e; }}).mouseup(function() { mouseDown = false;}).mouseleave(function() { $canvas.mouseup});context.beginPath()and such are the ways in which you can implement drawing interactivity to your app. The full thing is on CodePen or just work with it here:[codepen_embed height=&quot;800&quot; theme_id=&quot;0&quot; slug_hash=&quot;bdPrvw&quot; default_tab=&quot;result&quot; user=&quot;twhite96&quot;]See the Pen &amp;lt;a href=&#39;http://codepen.io/twhite96/pen/bdPrvw/&#39;&amp;gt;bdPrvw&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; by Tiffany White (&amp;lt;a href=&#39;http://codepen.io/twhite96&#39;&amp;gt;@twhite96&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) on &amp;lt;a href=&#39;http://codepen.io&#39;&amp;gt;CodePen&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.[/codepen_embed]",

Before we had a Go button but what good is that? You would select the dropdown and the link to say, an FAQ, and then press ‚ÄúGo‚Äù. Well what about just going to that page when you touch or click on the dropdown menu link for that page? That is what we did by changing the whole behavior of the dropdown, and eliminating the appended Go button. Here is the code:$select.change(function() { //Go to select&#39;s locaiton window.location = $select.val();$select.change(function() { //Go to select&#39;s locaiton window.location = $select.val();$select.change(function() { //Go to select&#39;s locaiton window.location = $select.val();});The.val()gets the select input without passing any arguments.

We wanted to make sure the image we clicked on in the image gallery would execute the behavior we wanted, which was popping up the lightbox. Using$(this).attr(&amp;amp;quot;href&amp;amp;quot;)assured us that we were clicking the linked image attribute in the HTML, and it wouldn&#39;t matter which image was clicked. Here is the last part of the code://Capture the click event on a link to an image$(&amp;amp;quot;#imageGallery a&amp;amp;quot;).click(function(event){   event.preventDefault();   var imageLocation = $(this).attr(&amp;amp;quot;href&amp;amp;quot;); //Update overlay with the image linked in the link   $image.attr(&amp;amp;quot;src&amp;amp;quot;, imageLocation);//Show the overlay.   $overlay.show();//Get child&#39;s alt attribute and set caption   var captionText = $(this).children(&amp;amp;quot;img&amp;amp;quot;).attr(&amp;amp;quot;alt&amp;amp;quot;);   $caption.text(captionText);});//When overlay is clicked  $overlay.click(function(){ //Hide the overlay  $overlay.hide();//Capture the click event on a link to an image$(&amp;amp;quot;#imageGallery a&amp;amp;quot;).click(function(event){   event.preventDefault();   var imageLocation = $(this).attr(&amp;amp;quot;href&amp;amp;quot;); //Update overlay with the image linked in the link   $image.attr(&amp;amp;quot;src&amp;amp;quot;, imageLocation);//Show the overlay.   $overlay.show();//Get child&#39;s alt attribute and set caption   var captionText = $(this).children(&amp;amp;quot;img&amp;amp;quot;).attr(&amp;amp;quot;alt&amp;amp;quot;);   $caption.text(captionText);});//When overlay is clicked  $overlay.click(function(){ //Hide the overlay  $overlay.hide();});",

But we also added a button to the DOM in the HTML with this$(&amp;quot;.spoiler&amp;quot;).append(&amp;quot;&amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Reveal Spoiler!&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&amp;quot;);Also we went over event handlers. So now that we have the button made in our HTML you can add a$(&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;).click(function(){});with passing an anonymous function in order to do something when the button we made is pressed.$(this)So in the code block with the button selector with the [jquery].click(function() {});[/jquery] you can do nifty things. So inside this code block we used$(this).show();$(this).remove();$(this).show();$(this).remove();$(this).show();$(this).remove();I hadn‚Äôt really gotten my head around [jquery]$(this)[/jquery] until he explained that since we had two&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;elements under the&amp;lt;div class= &amp;quot;spoiler&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class= &amp;quot;spoiler&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;we needed to specify which button the.show();and.remove();when clicked. So I found that$(this)is magical. So when I click on the first spoiler button, this knows what to do with it. It knows I‚Äôm not clicking the second spoiler button. It knows to hide remove the second one when I am clicking the first. Cool stuff.It was a pretty easy lesson since I have gone over this on Codecademy and Free Code Camp.

      "title": "Day 1: Java with Multiple Strings, Formatters, and Conditionals",
      "content"	 : "What I learned‚Ä¶errr last night was about using multiple strings with formatters in Java. For instance:String name = ‚ÄúTiffany‚Äù;String age = 30;console.printf(‚ÄúMy name is %s and I am %s years old.‚Äù, name, age);String name = ‚ÄúTiffany‚Äù;String age = 30;console.printf(‚ÄúMy name is %s and I am %s years old.‚Äù, name, age);This is sort of like when I was doing Learn Python the Hard Way only the syntax is different and more verbose.I learned how to get information into the console by way of prompting the user. So you have the console object and the method readLine to say something like:console.readLine(‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù);console.readLine(‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù);console.readLine(‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù);This was interesting, getting to learn these new methods for a new language. Also knowing the Java is compiled and how to run the compile command with:javacjavacjavacI learned more about integers and getting an integer from a string. Whereas in JavaScript you‚Äôd use:parseIntparseIntparseIntin Java you have this long string:Integer.parseIntInteger.parseIntInteger.parseIntBuilding things and adding conditions was interesting as well. Here is a little snippet of the app we built in Java:String name = console.readLine(‚ÄúEnter a name: ‚Äù);String adjective = console.readLine(‚ÄúEnter an adjective: ‚Äù);String noun;boolean isInvalidWord;do {    noun = console.readLine(‚ÄúEnter a noun: ‚Äù);    isInvalidWord = (noun.equalsIgnoreCase(‚Äúdork‚Äù) ||                     noun.equalsIgnoreCase(‚Äújerk‚Äù));    if (isInvalidWord) {    console.printf(‚ÄúThat language is not allowed. Try again. nn‚Äù);  }} while(isInvalidWord);String name = console.readLine(‚ÄúEnter a name: ‚Äù);String adjective = console.readLine(‚ÄúEnter an adjective: ‚Äù);String noun;boolean isInvalidWord;do {    noun = console.readLine(‚ÄúEnter a noun: ‚Äù);    isInvalidWord = (noun.equalsIgnoreCase(‚Äúdork‚Äù) ||                     noun.equalsIgnoreCase(‚Äújerk‚Äù));    if (isInvalidWord) {    console.printf(‚ÄúThat language is not allowed. Try again. nn‚Äù);  }} while(isInvalidWord);To be honest, Java isn‚Äôt really too bad. I don‚Äôt like the verbosity. For instance in JavaScript you can call a method:noun.toLowerCasenoun.toLowerCasenoun.toLowerCaseinstead of what we‚Äôve got here in Java. Java is a little better in that the .equalsIgnoreCase makes things simpler so I could call it on any object and the case would be ignored completely. But it just looks cleaner.So that was my experience fo Java Beginner Basic Course on Treehouse. I plan on diving deeper as the semester grinds on. For now, it‚Äôs learning RegEx and then back to JavaScript as I want to start thinking about building my app.",

I didn‚Äôt do it everyday but I would go on streaks of doing the Waypoints and then stop. When it was time for me to return I was completely lost. I was learning but what I found is that whenever I had to complete a challenge on Codecademy or write my own program, I‚Äôd continually need to look at the hints or Q&amp;amp;A forums. There were only a few times I didn‚Äôt need to do that and it was frustrating me. I know that I am far from stupid but this type of constantly second-guessing myself was making me feel incredibly inadequate. I thought, a lot, that I wasn‚Äôt cut out for this at all.Then comes me visiting Nick Queen‚Äôs blog and seeing his Treehouse badges. My buddy Mark had started Treehouse as well and I had checked it out, signed up for a free trial but never used it. I let my free trial dwindle because I didn‚Äôt have a school ID to get the school discount and I honestly didn‚Äôt see the point. I was already doing just fine with Free Code Camp and Learn Python the Hard Way. But stopping by Nick‚Äôs site and talking to him and seeing his progress on Twitter, as well as how improved Mark was in his knowledge of JavaScript I thought I‚Äôd sign up for a new account and trial and actually work through it.So I started the HTML track and skipped it. I then started the CSS track and found just how much I was actually learning in such short amount of time. The key is: videos and explanations, plus following along with Workspaces. These three things help you get a grasp on the material. There are quizzes and challenges that make certain you have a grasp on the concepts.I went ahead and skipped majority of the CSS beginners track as I have a JavaScript project looming and I know enough CSS to get by.I am learning so much in such a short time that I have even more app ideas. The explanations behind the concepts is something I appreciate. I often had to reach out to other people to find out the why of something. For instance:$(this)I am certain Treehouse has answers for me about this and I kinda grok it. But I am looking to Treehouse to make it even more clearer.I have gotten 5 badges in three days and I am excited to get more. The gamification of all these sites really keeps you in them.

The chatroom is so great that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever give it up. I am hoping Treehouse gets a Slack or Gitter because that is the next step to make it great. I‚Äôll have to pay for Treehouse, unlike Free Code Camp, but that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs $9/mo for students so not too much of a burden. And you can pause your enrollment at any time.

It cut into my coding time but I finally settled in around 1 PM, a full four hours after I woke up and one after I scheduled to code.So I continued to tackle while loops. The idea of scope was covered. But writing my own for, do, and while loops I kept forgetting to declare a condition in a variable. Then I also forgot about global and local scope. So my loop looked something like this:var count = 1;for (var i = 0; i &amp;amp;lt; 10; i++) { while(count &amp;amp;lt; 3) {  console.log(&amp;amp;quot;What the fuck am I even doing&amp;amp;quot;);  count++ }}I was so frustrated with the fact I felt like I was flying blind that I had a total give up console.log in the loop (pardon the expletive).I didn‚Äôt understand why this executed. So I turned to the Code Newbie Slack team and after a long while with me looking like an idjit, I came to realize the loop I wrote was awful. Awful because it didn‚Äôt take into consideration the scope, local and global.So the first line, my condition, is in global scope. This screws up everything inside the while loop.

The console.log prints out the string according to the count twice and then runs 9 more times and fails. It gets stuck at 3 and never resets‚Ä¶still thinking about why there.Here is what the loop should look like, to include local scope:for (var i = 0; i &amp;amp;lt; 10; i++) {  var count = 1;   while(count &amp;amp;lt; 3) {    console.log(&amp;amp;quot;What the fuck am I even doing&amp;amp;quot;);    count++  }}Feeling stupid much?(Thinking about this while Rihanna sings ‚ÄúBitch better have my money‚Äù on Beats1, Ha.

I have a lot going on and priorities need to be set. First, it starts with my calendar:I deleted A LOT of fluff and old commitments. I tried to streamline what I do and when. No, I will not code for 8 hours a day. Three days a week I must get to the gym. This is imperative. I have time to read, code and blog, and record podcasts and edit them. I have to scale back screencasting as it is time intensive and I don‚Äôt have lots of time. I guess I do, but I need to prioritize it. I block out time for email and that is the only time. I will get to bed earlier (I really need to do this anyway as class starts in a month and a half and I have a recitation at 11 am, being an hour away from class). I will get up earlier. I will SAIC (Sit ass in chair) and code after trying to get awake.I have a time to read and a time to screw off. I feel really committed to my Pirates but having the TV off, which it is most of time, is key.I used to write these same types of posts when I was a writer. A lot of it is fear of success. If you listened to my Code &amp;amp; Supply episode which you can find here, you‚Äôll know my story. Being a success once and failing is a big monkey on my back that I am trying to shake.For the record, I do code. I sit down, some time during the week, and knock out just one Codecademy challenge. This has been of late. I am not working hard enough, I am not grinding hard enough and I am trying to figure out why.I have this blog and another that are active (two more that are not). I have the podcast and the podcast contribution to Code &amp;amp; Supply. And then there are meetups and and the gym. But more often than not, I am distracted by Slack, Gitter, Facebook, Twitter the Pittsburgh Pirates (BUCN!!). I have the tools to stop the distractions. That‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is sitting in the chair and working.I will have Airmail open and that red badge will pop up and I will look at the email/newsletter and open links. I‚Äôll troll Hacker News or Medium, even with the main websites blocked.

Since we have an array and counting in the array begins at 0, the second part of the for loop is going to calculate the number of names in the names variable, or the length of the array. Then in the last part of the for loop, the loop is coming back around and counting up to the next name. It will do this because the ++ means to increase by 1. It will do this for the length of the array, and for as long as i is less than the length of the array.

I am looking forward to the challenge, however.So I am working through exercise 15. The text file we are to open and read in python contains some arbitrary text. We are still working with argument variables and the command raw_input(), but we‚Äôre throwing in the argvfilenamewith another commandopenwhich just opens the file taking a parameter which returns a value, kind of like raw_input, that you can set to any variable you want, according to pydoc (which is the document system built into python‚Äì excellent resource, aside from Dash).Here is the script I wrote:from sys import argvscript, filename = argvtxt = open(filename)print ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your file %r:‚Äù % filenameprint txt.read()print ‚ÄúType the filename again:‚Äùfile_again = raw_input(‚Äú&amp;gt; ‚Äù)txt_again = open(file_again)print txt_again.read()Here is my script with the comments I wrote, an annotation that Zed Shaw encourages.#Grabs the sys module and the argv variable inside that modulefrom sys import argv#sets the argument variables to script and filemane&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;script, filename = argv#when we type the script into the terminal, you have to type in the filename as well that you want to open. This filename must be an arguement variable when you run the python script. txt indicates that it is a txt file. Open(filenmae) calls the argument variable that we specified was ex15_sample.txt and opens it, taking a parameter and returning a value you can set as your own value, much like raw_inputtxt = open(filename)#this line prints out text and opens an formatter which is the argument variable filename.print ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your file %r:‚Äù % filename#here we call a function on the text file which is read(). To give a file a command you use the dot and and function so txt.read() opens the file without getting any parameters.print txt.read()#this line prints this line of text in the script in terminalprint ‚ÄúType the filename again:‚Äù#this is another prompt with raw_input and the caret assigned to the variable file_again. You must type in the name of the text file again or python will throw an errorfile_again = raw_input(‚Äú&amp;gt; ‚Äù)#this line uses the open command to open the txt file againtxt_again = open(file_again)#this line uses the function read() which is part of the command you‚Äôre giving the filetxt_again.read().

      "content"	 : "Going through more Zed Shaw tutorials with Learn Python the Hard Way and finding it excellent as it gets more challenging. We are working with argument variables, which hold the arguments you pass through your python script until called later.He let us know that part of the command:python ex13.pywas an argument, that part being:ex13.pyWe then wrote a script that accepted arguments. First, the first line of the script was:from sys import argvImporting lets you add modules to your python script. Instead of piling in modules, python let‚Äôs you choose which ones you want. In this case we have the sys or system module. I am not sure what a system module is or what modules do yet, as I am at exercise 14 and still working through it.Next we have the argument variables:script, first, second, third = argvWe call these variables, I am not sure if the correct word is call, I know it is for object-oriented programming, and I am not sure if python relies on objects like Ruby. But anyway‚Ä¶This was the part of the script that would run when called in terminal:print ‚ÄúThe script is called:‚Äù, scriptprint ‚ÄúYour first variable is:‚Äù, firstprint ‚ÄúYour second variable is:‚Äù, secondprint ‚ÄúYour third variable is:‚Äù, thirdWhen first running this in terminal I got a ValueError returned to me:python ex13.pyTraceback (most recent call last):File ‚Äúex13.py‚Äù, line 3, inscript, first, second, third = argvValueError: need more than 1 value to unpackIt seemed that I didn‚Äôt reference enough arguments. I then reread the tutorial and saw that I needed to specify the arguments by typing in a random name:python ex13.py first 2nd 3rdThe script is called: ex13.pyYour first variable is: firstYour second variable is: 2ndYour third variable is: 3rdI replicated this according to the tutorial, trying to understand what the error was. I was a bit confused. I thought that I had four arguments, not five when I typed the following in:python ex13.py first 2ndTraceback (most recent call last):File ‚Äúex13.py‚Äù, line 3, inscript, first, second, thrid = argvValueError: need more than 3 values to unpackI was literally stuck on this. Went into the Code Newbie Slack team looking for help and voila! I got some from the truly smart people there. I forgot that ex13.py was an argument as well. So I did only have four arguments. In the last example, my three unpacked arguments were, ex13.py, first, and 2nd. I needed one more, not 3. It may sound weird but my mind was lost.So now that I know that I moved onto exercise 14, mixing in prompts with argument variables, format variables, and the like.Here is the script:from sys import argvscript, user_name = argvprompt = ‚Äò&amp;gt;‚Äôprint ‚ÄúHi, %s, I‚Äôm the %s script.‚Äù % (user_name, script)print ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to ask you a few questions.‚Äùprint ‚ÄúDo you like me %s?‚Äù % user_namelikes = raw_input(prompt)print ‚ÄúWhere do you live %s?‚Äù % user_namelives = raw_input(prompt)print ‚ÄúWhat kind of computer do you have?‚Äùcomputer = raw_input(prompt)print &quot;&quot;‚ÄúAlright, so you said %r about liking me.You live in %r. Not sure where that is.And you have %r computer. Nice.‚Äù&quot;&quot; % (likes, lives, computer)Took me a bit to get that I was assigning a prompt to variables.

Well, I have an even better solution.First off, let me say that learning HTML and CSS all day is great if you want to do web dev and that is what I want to do, maybe. I am finding that building apps and scripts is fun. The reason I am doing Python now is because of my Raspberry Pi. I wanted to program it this summer and I know very little Python so I looked for a good alternative to the Codecademy Python course which was just a fragmented bit of Python learning. I wasn‚Äôt grasping the concepts, nor was I being asked to think about the things I was learning.So I remembered fro Code Newbie Podcast Zed Shaw. He had written a book called Learn Python the Hard Way and offered it up for free as HTML on the book‚Äôs website. So I went. And I started. And I‚Äôm hooked.So what made it great? Study Drills. Enforcing the fact that you should type everything on the screen, use a text editor and not an IDE (which I was really tempted to do) and the questions he answers from previous students. You get to practice what you learn, to, by building little scripts on your own. Here is an example of a form script I wrote using Python, from exercise 11 Study Drill:print ‚ÄúWhat is your occupation?‚Äù,occupation = raw_input()print ‚ÄúHow many kids do you own?‚Äù,kids = raw_input()print ‚ÄúDo you like cats? Answer like or do not like‚Äù,cats = raw_input()print ‚ÄúWhat is your reputation on Stack Overflow‚Äù,stack_overflow = raw_input()print ‚ÄúSo you do %r, own %r kids, %r cats, have a reputation of %r on Stack Overflow.‚Äù % (occupation, kids, cats, stack_overflow)print ‚ÄúWhat is your occupation?‚Äù,occupation = raw_input()print ‚ÄúHow many kids do you own?‚Äù,kids = raw_input()print ‚ÄúDo you like cats?

I bounce between all three and haven‚Äôt finished a single course. I am frustrated right now because learning is taking a long time. The courses take time. And I am used to things moving fast, learning fast, and being good after a short amount of time. That‚Äôs how I wrote fiction. But this is different. I have to know that and not get frustrated in the process.So I‚Äôve decided to pick two sites for now, which will be Codecademy and The Odin Project because these two sites work in concert with one another. Which is what I should be doing now instead of writing this blog post. It is, after all, spring break. I need to get some coding in before class starts back up Monday.

Well, the fact I left my high school in Harrisburg to attend a sort of school for behavioral misfits was a problem because Harrisburg High School didn‚Äôt put the date on my transcripts of my graduation. And when I called they had no record of me graduating. So essentially the problem was no one knew who the hell I was and so I needed to get the diploma to even stand a chance of getting into Pitt. I have my physical high school diploma but it was just too much bureacracy hassle for Pitt and all involved.So I got that lovely dipolma and have emailed all the right people for my journey into a university. I emailed Dr. John Ramirez of the Comp Sci department and it looks like it isn‚Äôt going to be a bad go of things. Just opening up my thinking to theory and knowing how to apply it to real-world coding situations. I am not keen on learning theory. I just want to build. But I know the limitations in Pittsburgh for coporations that hire developers, and the BS in computer science barrier to entry. Anyway, I am going and even though I say I wouldn‚Äôt go this route if I didn‚Äôt have to I probably would anyway as getting a degree, though not important, is important to me.",

Stack Overflow to the rescue!So. I got four answers and tried three before I tried this:footer {background: rgba(113,15,154,0.73);}footer div {width: 32%;border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.00);display: inline-block;vertical-align: top;text-align: center;}footer div section {max-width: 100%;margin: auto;padding: 20px;text-align: center;}footer {background: rgba(113,15,154,0.73);}footer div {width: 32%;border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.00);display: inline-block;vertical-align: top;text-align: center;}footer div section {max-width: 100%;margin: auto;padding: 20px;text-align: center;}And boom. Fixed‚Ä¶but not quite.There was an issue with the Font Awesome icons that I still can‚Äôt get right‚Äì the dribble icon was floating right of the footer. I decided to put the icons in a div id container and style it.

Why does responsive code have to be so verbose? The main complaint, it seems from devs who are tons more experienced than me, is that it is slower loading. I mean, I guess if you traverse around the interwebs, you will see complaints about slow responsive sites.I copied the code, just as expected. Tweaked the margins of the columns but yet the footer background color I wanted just didn&#39;t span the width of the body. I edited all the css and I still couldn&#39;t get it right, Googled like a fiend, copied this, tweaked that and until I deleted the responsive code my footer was a mess.My friend Piper helped me out but somewhere in my HTML there is a problem. We decided that using this:&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/footer&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/footerfor the HTML andfooter div { width: 30%, margin: 4.5% } display: inline-block for the CSS would get the desired effect, which is a footer that looks like this:But it didn‚Äôt turn out like that.

It is the older version and it looks it.Tonight, going through the textbook, I learned a little bit about sequential processing, conditionals, and reductionismor problem decompostion. It was a few hours ago and I don&amp;#8217;t quite remember what each was, word for word but it is sort of like sequential processing and problem reductionism have similar ways of thinking. First I do this, then this, then I&amp;#8217;ll do this in order to complete this complex task. The example given was of cleaning your house: you take the living room first, then the bathroom, bedrooms, etc in order to complete cleaning the whole, breaking the complex task down into managable parts.Got to the part of the text where we&amp;#8217;d need to be sitting in front of the computer and I looked at the interface some more. I picked the space template but there are tons more our prof is going to give us in class tomorrow, I am assuming.The text offered some insights on 2D and 3D modeling and what and where things were/are. I then started playing around with the interface, ignoring the text altogether:I added a female scientist and a male scientist but of course, the female will be my lead. I also added a ship and a probe.Here is the quad view:The program is rich with things I can do. I click on an object and can resize it, move different parts of the ship, or the bodies, I can rotate them, tell them what to say and do, adjust the camera angle. What I am a little concerned about is the natural language part of learning the commands&amp;#8211; no technical programmers speak and you can&amp;#8217;t really write a bug. I guess since this is just to whet the appetite of would-be programmers it&amp;#8217;s okay.Once I get more into it I&amp;#8217;ll do some screencasts of the program coming together.",

I am taking a Fundamentals of Programming class using Alice, a drag and drop, storytelling object oriented programming app for Mac, PC, and Linux. Best part about it is it&amp;#8217;s free. Today was the first day of class and I am already excited. While I have a biology class as well this is a coding blog so we&amp;#8217;ll get down to that. Our professor seems nice (despite still using hotmail) but a bit flighty. He has a firm grasp on things, unlike my web dev professor from last semester and also unlike last semester, I need to build something that looks good, functions well, and has as few bugs as possible.I just installed the older version of Alice as that is what is required for the course. I had version 3 but he pretty much advised against it, citing it to be a work-in-progress or beta, as the tech crowd would call it. The use of a thumb drive, though he suggests it, is out of the question. I will back it all up to Dropbox, the files, and when I get to class I will download them to the desktop and upload them back again, once I am finished. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you can drag and drop from the browser yet. Haven&amp;#8217;t tried it.All and all it was a great day. As a gym rat I spent yesterday at the gym working on my legs and today was awfully painful. So tonight, instead of working primarily at the desk, I am going to lay in bed for a while and read the Programming with Alice textbook and drink coffee.
