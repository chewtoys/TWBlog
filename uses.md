Seems that a lot of developers are creating these `/uses` pages after discovering [Wes Bos’s](https://twitter.com/wesbos) [/uses page](http://wesbos.com/uses).

My favorite of these happens to be from [Jon Suh](https://twitter.com/jonsuh). His [/uses page](https://jonsuh.com/uses/) includes a photo, which is what I did here.

While I was interning, I had enough money to make my desk setup look *sick* as Wes and Scott would say. So some of the stuff below will change.

## Gear

Let’s start with my gear.

- [27” iMac, Retina 5K, late 2015](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1190385-REG/apple_mk462ll_a_27_imac_with_retina.html)
	- I just bought this earlier this year and Apple updates it five months later. Oh well.
- [iPhone 8 Plus 256gb, Space Gray](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/apple-iphone-8-plus?color=spacegray&memory=256gb) [^1]

	- I moved some of my writing workflow over to this iPad with this case. It is heavy and bulky but cheaper than Apple’s case.
- [Apple Pencil](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1190545-REG/apple_mk0c2am_a_pencil_for_ipad_pro.html?sts=pi)

	- I will never type on another iMac keyboard. **Ever**. I fly on the keyboard DEV loaned me during my internship. Not going back to desktop chicklet keys.
-  [Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7BK SonicPro Over-Ear High Res Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PEU9CFA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
	- These things sound *amazing*. Seriously good upgrade over my  previous Audio-Technica cans, the M50s.
- [Plantronics BeatBack Pro wireless headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MBWIL0G/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- I bought this when I thought I was serious about pod and screencasting. Heh. I still do a short show for Productivity in Tech.

<del datetime="2018-04-22T02:27:20+00:00">Next Gen gear
|Since I am moving and I have the money I decided to *upgrade* my desk setup. So here are some of the things I've purchased to get that rad *YouTuber setup* I so desperately envy.|</del>

As you can see I finally moved into my new place. My cable management game is all off and I haven't yet put the whole ALEX drawer together[^2] but soon. Soon.

- [IKEA LINNMON/ALEX Desk](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99932696/)
	- Every programmer needs a good desk. This one is relatively inexpensive.
- [Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016P9HJIA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- This will drive a lot of audio…as well as record from an XLR mic which I have. Said I was cooking things up. [I am](https://15minutesindev.io/home/).
- [MAKETECH Swivel Under-the-Desk USB 3.0 Hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWIIAOR/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- I got this as a companion to my Echo 1st Gen which you can find below. I wanted one for my room so I got the cheapest Echo I could find.
	- [Amazon Echo 1st Gen](http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B076PSZL29/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=thatmacnerd-20)

	- Yeah. I am on the bandwagon. I am a programmer and I want my desk to feel like a rocket ship. Sue me.
- [LIFX A19 Wi-fi Smart LED Bulb](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KY02MS8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- Where else am I going to put the LIFX Bulb?

## Software

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
	- It does everything I need it to do. Atom was nice and had a lot of features but goddamn it’s hella slow. So I went back to VS Code [^3] and couldn’t be happier.
- [Hyper.js](https://hyper.is/)
	- My new terminal of choice. Beautiful as hell and has gotten faster. Not as many bells and whistles as iTerm but good enough for me.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
	- I will never use a terminal without this installed.
- [Mac CLI](https://github.com/guarinogabriel/Mac-CLI)
	- Control pretty much every function your Mac can do, plus updating all packages across package managers, ssh, MySQL etc, right from your command line. Excellent tool.
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) for UI design
- [Boom 3D](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom3d/index.php)
	- This makes everything sound *amazing*.
- [Timing 2](https://timingapp.com/)
	- This is how I can find out how much time I spend on Twitter.
- Xcode
- Evernote
- Chrome
- [Transmit 5 for Mac](https://www.panic.com/transmit/)
	- There are cheaper, free, FTP clients out there but my first text editor was Coda and I liked it so much I bought Panic’s FTP client. It looks good and functions quite well. I moved on from Coda when I became “serious”.
- nvAlt
	- Brett Terpstra made a fork of Notational Velocity’s plain text note app and I use it for quick notes.
- PopClip
	- Using PopClip is a lifesaver. When it doesn’t work I am lost.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
	- Workflows make this my favorite app. I can’t live without it. You can find my workflows [here](https://cl.ly/1W2N1P1z213i/Alfred_workflows.jpg). I have way too many, I admit.
- Text Expander
- [Affinity Designer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/affinity-designer/id824171161?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- I am trying to learn how to use this better.
- [Affinity Photo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/affinity-photo/id824183456?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- Definitely replaces Adobe CC for me.
- Amphetamine to keep my Mac awake
- Spark for email that isn’t Gmail
- [Shell Runner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shell-runner/id689441182?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- To test shell scripts
- [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is my choice for window snapping.
- [Expressions](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expressions/id913158085?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) to test regular expressions
- [SnippetsLab](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snippetslab/id1006087419?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- Starting to manage snippets with Alfred and GitHub gists but this is a great way to organize snippets with a keystroke.
- [Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quiver-the-programmers-notebook/id866773894?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is a programmers notebook to take notes with syntax highlighting and markdown support. Supports many languages [^4].
- Twitter on the desktop using a cool little npm utility called [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier). In order to get Twitter with 2FA to work follow [these instructions](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier/issues/420#issuecomment-325625125) and you have a sort of native Twitter client on your Mac or Windows computer.

- [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/). This is a chat aggregator. Open source and wayyyyyy better looking than Rambox.
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for tasks.[^5]
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) for Project management.[^6]
- [Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) for scheduling
- [Dash 4](https://kapeli.com/dash). [^7]
- [Ship - Native Issue Tracking for GitHub](https://www.realartists.com/)
- [Sip for Mac](https://sipapp.io/) for a color picker

## I Use a lot of software, I admit

But I use ALL OF IT.

So this is my setup and what I am currently using. You can show me your dev setup on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412).

[^1]: Ordered the iPhone 8 Plus. Put away some money and with T-Mobile JUMP! I was able to get it for less than it would be outright. Got it in Space Gray, 256gb.
[^2]: Done and done
[^3]: I did have Ulysses installed. They even featured me on [their blog](https://ulyssesapp.com/blog/2018/04/tiffany-r-white/). I mainly used it to post to WordPress and since I am on Jekyll for everything now I don't need the subscription. I feel really bad. But now I use VSCode for this and a couple scripts to post here and my other blogs.
[^4]: Even brainfuck!
[^5]: This is the only task manager that I actually look at and use. It is *that* beautiful, simple, and it has impressed me far more than any task manager in recent memory.
[^6]: This is such a deep app and I am in love with it. After avoiding it because I was a heavy user of Evernote and quite liked it, there were things that annoyed me about it. Everyone talked about this app, Notion and I signed up. Been using it for two weeks and I have paid the subscription. It's that good. Still setting it up but here's my [dashboard](https://cl.ly/e8ed18d3f574/Screenshot-2018-09-05_12-00-33_AM.png).
[^7]: Offline docs ftw! Plus much more.
