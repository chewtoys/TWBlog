Well, this episode is a tad off-- monitoring myself while recording throws off my speech-- I would assume it does it to everyone **that listens to themselves really freaking loud**. So there's some odd talking and pauses but I figured out I need to turn down the monitor enough so I can actually talk without dragging my speech out. Trial and error, no?
