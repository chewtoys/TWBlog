I am a *big time music head*. All kinds[^1].

I am thinking of sharing things I'm listening to.

I stopped my Spotify subscription in favor of Apple Music, however, I will link to my Spotify playlists[^2] of similar songs if I can find them.

## F*ck Bitches, Get Money

I love that particular song. There other faves on here from Childish Gambino, Schoolboy Q, Kendrick, QOTSA, Mansionz, and more.

*Enjoy*.

[^1]: Doom Metal, Metalcore, Old school Thrash Metal, Grindcore, Hardcore, Post-hardcore, Hip Hop, Psychedelic Rock, Shoegaze, Old Punk, Grunge, Pop. Never Country. Sorry.
[^2]: These two playlists differ slightly, outside of their names. I did some editing to the Apple Music playlist as I copied it over from Spotify.
