Seems that a lot of developers are creating these `/uses` pages after discovering [Wes Bos’s](https://twitter.com/wesbos) [/uses page](http://wesbos.com/uses).

My favorite of these happens to be from [Jon Suh](https://twitter.com/jonsuh). His [/uses page](https://jonsuh.com/uses/) includes a photo, which is what I did here.

While I was interning, I had enough money to make my desk setup look *sick* as Wes and Scott would say. So some of the stuff below will change.

## Gear

Let’s start with my gear.

- [27” iMac, Retina 5K, late 2015](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1190385-REG/apple_mk462ll_a_27_imac_with_retina.html)
	- I just bought this earlier this year and Apple updates it five months later. Oh well.
- [iPhone XS Max 256gb, Gold](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/apple-iphone-8-plus?color=spacegray&memory=256gb) [^1]

  - This thing is a *beast*. Fast, and the industrial design is my *favorite* of Apple's iPads to date.
- [Brydge Keyboard for 2018 iPad Pro](https://www.brydge.com/pages/2018-ipad-pro-keyboard-interest-form)
	- I'm *really* looking forward to this as I am thinking of moving a lot of small code edits and my blogging workflow to the new iPad.
- [Apple Pencil](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1441874-REG/apple_mu8f2am_a_apple_pencil_2nd_generation.html)
	- Still trying to figure out a use for it. I use it for editing videos and podcasts currently.
- [DAS Keyboard 4 Professional for Mac Clicky MX  Blue Mechanical Switches](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TU7UA7W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)
	- I will never type on another iMac keyboard. **Ever**. I fly on the keyboard DEV loaned me during my internship. Not going back to desktop chicklet keys.
-  [Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7BK SonicPro Over-Ear High Res Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PEU9CFA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

- [Plantronics BeatBack Pro wireless headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MBWIL0G/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- I bought this when I thought I was serious about pod and screencasting. Heh. I still do a short show for Productivity in Tech.
- [AirPods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/)

---

As you can see I finally moved into my new place. My cable management game is all off and I haven't yet put the whole ALEX drawer together[^2] but soon. Soon.

- [IKEA LINNMON/ALEX Desk](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S99932696/)
	- Every programmer needs a good desk. This one is relatively inexpensive.
- [Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf Speakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016P9HJIA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- Since I will be moving soon, some of these items I haven’t used yet. This is one of those items. Everyone raves about this mouse so I want to give it a go.
- [Aenfor aluminum gaming mousepad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074L6Z5P3/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- This will drive a lot of audio…as well as record from an XLR mic which I have. Said I was cooking things up.
- [MAKETECH Swivel Under-the-Desk USB 3.0 Hub](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWIIAOR/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s01?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

	- I got this as a companion to my Echo 1st Gen which you can find below. I wanted one for my room so I got the cheapest Echo I could find.
	- [Amazon Echo 1st Gen](http://www.amazon.com/dp/product/B076PSZL29/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=thatmacnerd-20)

- [LIFX A19 Wi-fi Smart LED Bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KY02MS8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?psc=1&tag=thatmacnerd-20&ie=UTF8)

  - As I do more webinars, Egghead videos, and yes, soon, streaming, I need a good webcam. I have a [Streaming Amazon List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/WYX3PZGSUJWN?tag=thatmacnerd-20&sort=default) that I'll be adding to my arsenal in the next couple months.

## Software

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
	- It does everything I need it to do. Atom was nice and had a lot of features but goddamn it’s hella slow. So I went back to VS Code [^3] and couldn’t be happier.
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
	- Back to iTerm. It's just *better*.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
	- I will never use a terminal without this installed.
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) for UI design
- [Boom 3D](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom3d/index.php)
	- This makes everything sound *amazing*.
- [Timing 2](https://timingapp.com/)
	- This is how I can find out how much time I spend on Twitter.
- Xcode
- Evernote
- Chrome
- [Transmit 5 for Mac](https://www.panic.com/transmit/)
	- There are cheaper, free, FTP clients out there but my first text editor was Coda and I liked it so much I bought Panic’s FTP client. It looks good and functions quite well. I moved on from Coda when I became “serious”.
- nvAlt
	- Brett Terpstra made a fork of Notational Velocity’s plain text note app and I use it for quick notes.
- PopClip
	- Using PopClip is a lifesaver. When it doesn’t work I am lost.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
	- Workflows make this my favorite app. I can’t live without it. You can find my workflows [here](https://cl.ly/1W2N1P1z213i/Alfred_workflows.jpg). I have way too many, I admit.
- Text Expander
- [Lightroom CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html)
	- For basic edits. Yeah, I bit on the Adobe train but only the photography bundle with 1TB of storage.
- [Lightroom Classic CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html)
  - For all my editing needs. It is what I started using years ago. Muscle memory, and all that.
- Amphetamine to keep my Mac awake
- [Shell Runner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shell-runner/id689441182?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- To test shell scripts
- [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is my choice for window snapping.
- [Expressions](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expressions/id913158085?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) to test regular expressions
- [SnippetsLab](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snippetslab/id1006087419?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS)
	- Starting to manage snippets with Alfred and GitHub gists but this is a great way to organize snippets with a keystroke.
- [Quiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quiver-the-programmers-notebook/id866773894?mt=12&at=+1001lnT5&ct=That+Mac+Nerd+iOS) is a programmers notebook to take notes with syntax highlighting and markdown support. Supports many languages [^4].
- [Tweetbot 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-2-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12)
  - The 3rd iteration hogs CPU and memory. If it was more efficient I'd use it; the ability to add gifs right in the app is killer. But it freezes constantly. So I use v2.
- [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/). This is a chat aggregator. Open source and wayyyyyy better looking than Rambox.
- [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for tasks.[^5]
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) for Project management.[^6]
- [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
  - Nothing beats it for note-taking and archiving.
- [Fantastical 2](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) for scheduling
- [Dash 4](https://kapeli.com/dash). [^7]
- [Sip for Mac](https://sipapp.io/) for a color picker
- [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)
  - As I get into making egghead lessons and more screencasts for That Mac Nerd, I need a heavy duty piece of software to do so. Screenflow fits the bill.
- [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/welcome)
  - Going to stream at Twitch soon enough. This is the gold standard but their Mac app is terribly behind the Windows app.
- [Private Internet Access VPN](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/)
  - Should always have a VPN.
- [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/)
  - This is how I share bugs and other things with devs and dev teams. Also an easy way to make a gif of a feature or bug on my Mac.
- [Setapp](https://setapp.com/)
  - It finally has enough utilities to make it worth the subscription price for me.

## I Use a lot of software, I admit

But I use ALL OF IT.

So this is my setup and what I am currently using. You can show me your dev setup on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiffanywhitedev).

![](./2.jpg)


[^1]: Got the gold and this will be my last iPhone for a while. No need to upgrade yearly as these phones are more than capable of lasting a couple years.
[^2]: Done and done
[^3]: I did have Ulysses installed. They even featured me on [their blog](https://ulyssesapp.com/blog/2018/04/tiffany-r-white/). I mainly used it to post to WordPress and since I am on Jekyll for everything now I don't need the subscription. I feel really bad. But now I use VSCode for this and a couple scripts to post here and my other blogs.
[^4]: Even brainfuck!
[^5]: This is the only task manager that I actually look at and use. It is *that* beautiful, simple, and it has impressed me far more than any task manager in recent memory.
[^6]: This is such a deep app and I am in love with it. After avoiding it because I was a heavy user of Evernote and quite liked it, there were things that annoyed me about it. Everyone talked about this app, Notion and I signed up. Been using it for two weeks and I have paid the subscription. It's that good. Still setting it up but here's my [dashboard](https://cl.ly/e8ed18d3f574/Screenshot-2018-09-05_12-00-33_AM.png).
[^7]: Offline docs ftw! Plus much more.
