Derek Sivers set up a website called [nownownow.com](http://nownownow.com/about) to help people understand what a now page is, why you‚Äôd want one, and to [showcase other now pages](http://nownownow.com/). Maybe you should build one, too.

## What Am I Doing *Now*?

I live on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, PA and I am currently learning at a breakneck pace full-stack web development with [Wes Bos Courses](https://wesbos.com/courses/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

I am trying to get into better shape and am doing well at it.

I am currently waiting to hear back from another internship opportunity.

I am working on two¬†blogs:

This one, Tiffany R. White Blog

[That Mac Nerd](https://thatmacnerd.com/blog/)
‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶

I am building a markdown grammar checker called [Check Yo Self](https://github.com/twhite96/checkyoself).

I am working on launching a new podcast called [DevBytes](https://devbytes.tech/home/).

I also have Evernote and Programming [^1] books in the works.

## What's On My Pocket Computer?

We carry these things everywhere. Inspired by another `/now` page I am posting a screenshot of my iPhone and iPad.

Sold my ailing MacBook Pro. Coda for iOS, Textastic, GoCoEdit, Working Copy, Affinity Photo, and Luma Fusion will make this a full on workstation.[/caption]

I can triage tasks and reply to messages without picking up my phone. Win.[/caption]

This may seem like a lot and it is. I don't know if I'll get everything done, but if I get into more of a routine, I think it is doable.

What are you doing? I‚Äôm curious by nature. Leave a comment. Or don‚Äôt.¬†ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
