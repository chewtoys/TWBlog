## Hi. I'm Tiffany.
I am an front-end dev in Pennsylvania. I have been programming as an autodidact and university student for three years. I attended the University of Pittsburgh for two years after a stint in a few junior colleges here in PA.

My toolbox contains JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, and CSS Grid and Flexbox. I am also learning Angular and Swift on the side.

Besides programming and writing for this blog, I enjoy photography, lifting weights when I can, and learning about AI, Machine Learning, and programming in Go.

This blog is an experiment so for now, just old jekyll content.
