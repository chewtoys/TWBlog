*Tiffany Talks Tech* is a monthly[^1] show that dives into tech so you don't have to. It's for the noobs, the tech literate, and everyone in between.

The YouTube channel, this blog, and social channels are venues for my setups, tech, ideas, and smart home reviews only not for a house but for those of us who rent apartments[^2].

My YouTube channel, this blog, and everything else is for you.

[^1]: For now...
[^2]: There isn't a lot of content for single folks who rent and don't want to own a home (apartment life!) or who are waiting to pony up for a house sometime later.
