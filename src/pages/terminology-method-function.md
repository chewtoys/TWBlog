In short: a *method* is a **function** that belongs to a class. In JavaScript, however, a *method* is a **function** that belongs to an ***object***.

Everything in JavaScript is an object; a **function** is an object; an *Array* is an object. This is a quirky design decision, but *because* most everything in JavaScript is an object, we can do neat things with  [Prototypal Inheritance](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-s-the-difference-between-class-prototypal-inheritance-e4cd0a7562e9). The nice thing about *prototypal inheritance* is that we can manipulate several different properties on the prototype chain *at once*.

Give that above article a read for more information. Also, check out the [Inheritance and the prototype chain article on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).
