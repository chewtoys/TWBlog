I have recently joined the [The Practical Dev](https://dev.to) as an apprentice software developer.

Remember when I said that good things were happening? That was one of the things.

Ben reached out in a Twitter DM and it kicked off.

I filled out the required application. We had a video conference yesterday and today they made the offer.

I can’t tell you how excited I am to be joining the team [^1]. This transcends just being in tech or having a career.

## Thanks, Ben and Peter

I mean, really. You two have taken a chance on an old lady who doesn’t have a degree but has a fire in her belly to actually learn and grow as a developer. I can’t thank you two enough. Truly. Thank you.

[^1]: I am old. I am the oldest person on the team. Haha. I am young at heart though. Goes to show someone pushing 40 can break into the industry if they work their asses off.
